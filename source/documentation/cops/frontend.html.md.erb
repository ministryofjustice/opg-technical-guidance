The Frontend Community of Practice was created to share and build knowledge of high quality Frontend engineering practice in OPG. 

This was previouwsly a monthly meeting, but that ran its course as capability was improved and GDS patterns embedded in teams. The ```#opg-frontend``` Slack channel is now primarily a place for questions and knowledge sharing. 

The primary output was an idealised frontend process shown below.

## Idealised Process

This diagram shows the idealised frontend process as agreed by the group:
