The OPG security community meets every two weeks on a Wednesday at 3pm. See ```#opg-security-community``` Slack channel for more information. 

The community exists to laern about security practice and build common guidelines to share with the wider OPG teams.

Recent work includes the logging baseline and social engineering guidelines.
