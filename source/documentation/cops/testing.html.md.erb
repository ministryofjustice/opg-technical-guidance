The testing community of practice meets every two weeks on a Thursday. Ask in #opg-testing for information and an invite. The group discuss test-driven approaches to development and the standards for testing in OPG Digital.

The initial meetings of the Testing COP put together some testing standards. If you would like to discuss these then please come along to the COP.
