## Context

CircleCI has been in use at OPG since 2018 and was our primary CI/CD tool for much of that time. It has been handling builds and deployments for all of our major services and code bases - including core items like `opg-org-infra`. However, after trailing GitHub Actions, which has organically grown to become our most widely used CI/CD tool, it is a suitable time to reassess our support and usage of CircleCI.

As GitHub Actions is an additional feature of GitHub - our primary code repository host - it is exceptionally well integrated with our code bases and offers a range of features that CircleCI does not support:

- Differential between a variable whose content should be seen as privileged or not (via secrets) and when using a secret the information is masked / redacted
- More granular access control for secrets / environment variables. They can be scope to individual steps to reduce risk of exfiltration (such as [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/security-update/) incident).
- Workflow permissions to restrict what can happen within the pipeline (eg read only access)
- Native [OIDC support](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) to further harden our infrastruture access
- Easier sharing of common tasks via reusable workflows.

CircleCI also had a concering security [breach](https://circleci.com/blog/jan-4-2023-incident-report/), which took a lot of effort to mitigate.


## Decision

All future projects, with the exception of Sirius related ones, will utilise GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Sirius projects will remain on Jenkins until the build overhead can be suitably reduced.

Migrate historical projects over as and when possible. 

Update terraform modules to remove CircleCI functionality in future versions to encourage this migration.

## Consequences

Any existing projects still on CircleCI will need to be migrated. While migrating, ensure correct secret usage. Reduce scope / access to both as much as possible with external workflows.

Check all runbooks are up to date and reference usage of GitHub or CircleCI accurately.
