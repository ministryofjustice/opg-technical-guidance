## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

We produce shared code and need to keep it well organised.

## Decision

The organisation of repositories for components, modules and packages produced by OPG digital's WebOps community should be small and specific over collected and centralised.

## Consequences

The OPG digital Webops community could proliferate lots of small repositories that will need to be maintained, but this can be a benefit to each. It enables finer version control, tight scoping, discrete automation and reduces barriers to publication.

Naming things is hard, and members of the community will need to keep good and relevant naming conventions to help others to find and understand the purpose of the shared code.
