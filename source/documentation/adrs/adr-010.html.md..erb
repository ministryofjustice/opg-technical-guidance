## Status

ðŸ¤” Proposed

## Context

With movement in teams, changes in team makeup and the ownership of components over time, teams have often had to take up ownership of code repositories that they did not originate. This can lead to issues if the code follows unfamiliar patterns or is in a different langauge to the one currently used by a team.

## Decision

If the ownership of an opg code repository changes, the team who currently has ownership has a responsibility to conduct a handover meeting covering:

- An introduction to the code and what it does
- Intro to the testing in the repo and its coverage
- An introduction the the build pipeline and how it works
- Discussion of any gotchas and how it might diverge from expectations
- A questions and answers session for the new team

The team handing over has responsibility to update all docs folders and runbooks before handover to ensure they are correct.

WebOps will only then change the repository code owners to the new team and update the ownership metadata.

Some repos may have been historically managed by teams who are no longer within the business. In which case it is the responsibility of the business area technical architect to prepare the handover meeting to the best of their ability and digital archaeology skills.

## Consequences

We will not have situations where teams have inherited code repositories they do not understand.

There is additional overhead to the handover process and hanbdover must be explicit.
