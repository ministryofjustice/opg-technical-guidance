# <%= current_page.data.title %>

### Date: 02-06-2021

## Status

ðŸ¤” Proposed

## Context

Establish a pattern for naming domains, currently we have a few variations across products and we should aim to be consistent where possible.

## Decision

### One Hosted Zone

All services will have a delegated hosted zone that lives inside of the management AWS Account.

`[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk`

### No Abbreivations

Dont use abbreivations in domains names where possible

Examples

A products preproduction environment should be
`preproduction.[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk`

## Consequences

Some products might have to do some slight refactoring work, however this shouldnt effect any production domains.
