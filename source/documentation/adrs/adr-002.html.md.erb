### Date: 02-06-2021

## Status

ðŸ¤” Proposed

## Context

Establish a pattern for naming domains, currently we have a few variations across products and we should aim to be consistent where possible.

## Decision

### Multiple Hosted Zones

Having multiple hosted zones is necessary if you have multiple stacks in an environment due a limitaion with
Amazon Certificate Manager. [See Wildcard Names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-certificate.html)

You should have a delegated hosted zone for each AWS Account, which becomes the domain for the primary environment
in that account. Production will not have a account prefix and live at the root level of the services domain

Production example:

`[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk`

Non-Production example:

`preproduction.[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk`
`development.[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk`

### Ephemeral Environments

ephemeral environments will live within the hosted zone of the account where the environment is created.

`[environment_name].development.[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk`

### No Abbreviations

Dont use abbreviations in domains names where possible, A products preproduction environment
should be:

`preproduction.[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk` not 'pre.[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk'

## Consequences

Some products might have to do some slight refactoring work, however this shouldnt effect any production domains.
