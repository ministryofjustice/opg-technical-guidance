### Date: 26-11-2021

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We have various prototypes of none-live services stoed in GitHub that need to be shared with internal and external stakeholders in a usable for.

Previously we had prototypes scattered on various unmanmaged Heroku instances. This has made tracking ownership and deployment harder as time went on.

Given that the MOJ Cloud PLatform can host things easily and provideds tooling to enable it, it makes sense to use it to host any prototypes produced for OPG Digital.


## Decision

Host any prototypes for new services on MOJ Cloud PLatform.

## Consequences

Any existing prototypes should be moved off Heroku and redirects put in place to their new location. The Heroku redirect repo provides code for this.
