## Description

UAL is a service for attorneys or donors (collectively known as _actors_) to allow 3rd party people and organisations to view a summary of an LPA online. The actors can also view the LPA summary themselves.

If an LPA has instructions and preferences, these are also available to view online. The [opg-data-lpa-instructions-preferences](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-data-lpa-instructions-preferences) service is responsible for storing and retrieving these.

There are two user-facing components to the service:

- View - this is the public facing part of the service where 3rd parties can view the LPA summary online
- Use - this is the part of the service where actors can view the LPA summary online and share it with 3rd parties. This is also sometimes known as the "actor" component.

### Impact of an outage

3rd parties will not be able to view the LPA summary online. Actors will not be able to view the LPA summary online or share it with 3rd parties. 3rd parties will need to be sent a paper copy of the LPA summary by the actor.

### Restrictions on access

public front: no restrictions for production, other environments are restricted to VPN, DOM1 and OPG Wifi
admin front: restricted to users on VPN, DOM1, OPG Wifi on all environments

### How to resolve specific issues

Specific re-occurring issues will be fixed as bug fixes. However in the event that we are alerted to an issue,
then we should first check the cloudwatch logs for our production log group thoroughly to identify the extent of the issue.

In the event that the issue is service affecting then we should follow the Incident process which can be found in this [repo](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/opg-technical-guidance/incidents/incident-response-process/#opg-incident-response-process).

As part of this process we may identify that we need to roll back to a previous version of the application in which case, use the redeploying services procedures in this [folder](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-lpa/tree/main/docs/runbooks).
