## Description

Sirius is the case management system for the Office of Public Guardian (OPG). It is used by OPG staff to manage the registration of Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) documents.

All attorneys, donors and Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) documents are stored in Sirius and have a unique Sirius ID (a 12 digit character beginning with 7000). This ID is used by other services to identity the resource.

### Impact of an outage

If Sirius is down, OPG staff will not be able to access the system to manage the registration of LPA documents. Cases will not be able to be progressed and the registration of LPA documents will be delayed.
