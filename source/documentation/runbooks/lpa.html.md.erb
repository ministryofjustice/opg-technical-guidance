### Consumers of this service

N/A

### Services consumed by this

- SendGrid
- Sirius LPA

### Restrictions on access

public front: no restrictions for production, other environments are restricted to VPN, DOM1 and OPG Wifi
admin front: restricted to users on VPN, DOM1, OPG Wifi on all environments

### How to resolve specific issues

Specific re-occurring issues will be fixed as bug fixes. However in the event that we are alerted to an issue,
then we should first check the cloudwatch logs for our production log group thoroughly to identify the extent of the issue.

In the event that the issue is service affecting then we should follow the Incident process which can be found in this [repo](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/opg-technical-guidance/incidents/incident-response-process/#opg-incident-response-process).

As part of this process we may identify that we need to roll back to a previous version of the application in which case, use the redeploying services procedures in this [folder](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-lpa/tree/master/docs/runbooks).
