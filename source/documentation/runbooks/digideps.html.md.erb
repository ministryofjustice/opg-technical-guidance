## Description

A service for court appointed professional and lay deputies to report to the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) on clients who are unable to manage their own affairs under the mental capacity act and the supervision of the aforementioned reports.

### Impact of an outage

Deputies will not be able to edit or submit their reports. OPG case management staff will not be able to view and review submitted reports. As a result there may be an increase in the number of calls from deputies to the OPG contact centre. Reputational impact to OPG if deputies can not submit reports. Potential for data loss with deputies who have started to fill information on a report and have not saved the data when the service goes down.

### How to resolve specific issues

Specific re-occurring issues will be fixed as bug fixes. However in the event that we are alerted to an issue,
then we should first check the cloudwatch logs for our production log group thoroughly to identify the extent of the issue.

In the event that the issue is service affecting then we should follow the Incident process which can be found in this [document](https://docs.opg.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/incidents/process.html#incident-response-process).

As part of this process we may identify that we need to roll back to a previous version of the application in which case, use the rollback procedure in this [folder](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-digideps/tree/main/docs/runbooks).

In the event that a simple fix forward or a rollback to a previous version of the application can't be performed then please check against disaster recovery document for recovery options for your [issue](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-digideps/blob/main/docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md).
