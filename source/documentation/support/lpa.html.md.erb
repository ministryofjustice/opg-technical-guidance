## Description

A service for members of the public to make a Lasting Power of Attorney. Users fill out online forms, pay a fee and can download the completed forms as a PDF which they can then sign and post to the Office of the Public Guardian to be registered.

When the user creates an LPA in Make an LPA, details of the LPA are only stored in the Make an LPA Postgres database. These details are not entered into Sirius until the printed form is received by OPG and the LPA is entered into Sirius by a caseworker.

### Impact of an outage

Users will not be able to create, access or download their LPA documents. Users will need to download the blank forms from GOV.UK, complete them by hand and post them to the Office of the Public Guardian if this service is down for a prolonged period of time.

### Restrictions on access

public front: no restrictions for production, other environments are restricted to VPN, MOJ Networks and OPG Wifi
admin front: restricted to users on VPN, MOJ Networks, OPG Wifi on all environments

### How to resolve specific issues

Specific re-occurring issues will be fixed as bug fixes. However in the event that we are alerted to an issue,
then we should first check the cloudwatch logs for our production log group thoroughly to identify the extent of the issue.

In the event that the issue is service affecting then we should follow the Incident process which can be found in this [document](https://docs.opg.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/incidents/process.html#incident-response-process).

As part of this process we may identify that we need to roll back to a previous version of the application in which case, use the redeploying services procedures in this [folder](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-use-an-lpa/tree/main/docs/runbooks).

Details for informing OPG Contact Centre are in this [document(https://opgtransform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LSML2/pages/2004058115/Contact+centre+triage+process) and [this one too](https://opgtransform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LSML2/pages/3727261701/Customer+queries)

### Environments

See [POAS deployment environments](https://opgtransform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/POAS/pages/3696295939/Deployment+environments) for list of environments and their relationship to other services.
