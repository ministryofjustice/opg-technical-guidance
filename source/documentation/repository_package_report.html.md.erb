This is the amalgated view of manifest and lock packages being used over our repositories, their licenses (where available), versions and location information.

This allows us to see a centralised view of what tooling we are using over the estate.

### Notes

In order for data to show here, the repository must include a workflow for our github action such as this.

This repository then includes a workflow to run the amalgamated action of the report and finally within the publishing workflow a stage to fetch that report and merge it to this page.
