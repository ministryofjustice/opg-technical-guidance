## Shell & Framework

Most of the WebOps community utilise [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) based shell which is now the default on Mac OS with [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).


## Aliases

A `~/.aliases` file used for common short cuts, mostly related to `aws-vault` and `terraform`

```bash

alias avend='aws-vault remove identity -s'
alias tf='ave identity -- terraform'
alias tfenv='avei -- env | grep TF_'
