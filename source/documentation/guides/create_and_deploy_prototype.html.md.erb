## Pre-requisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you will need:

* To be a member of the OPG GitHub team in the [MoJ GitHub Organisation]
* The [Cloud Platform CLI] installed
* A local development environment including a terminal and a git client

## 1. Clone the `opg-org-infra` repository

To create a repository, you need to raise a pull request
against the [opg-org-infra] repository.

Start by checking out a copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/opg-org-infra.git
cd opg-org-infra
```

## 2. Create your prototype kit repository

Under `services/` find the team which you are working on and create a file called: `component_prototype.tf`

Open the `component_prototype.tf` file you just created and add the following Terraform code:

> Make sure you replace `<TEAM_NAME>` with your team name!

```terraform
module "opg-<TEAM_NAME>-prototypes" {
  source                  = "../../modules/repository"
  name                    = "opg-<TEAM_NAME>-prototypes"
  developer_team          = data.github_team.opg.id
  default_branch_name     = "main"
  delete_branch_on_merge  = true
  has_issues              = false
  has_projects            = false
  has_wiki                = false
  require_ci_pass         = false
  template_repository     = "moj-prototype-template"
  visibility              = "public"
}
```

## 3. Raise a PR

After you have created that file and added the Terraform config, create a new branch,
`git add` the new file and then raise a pull request.

Once a member of the WebOps team has approved your PR, merge it.

When you merge the PR, a GitHub Action will apply the Terraform.
Your new prototype repository has a deployment workflow, implemented as a GitHub Action, which will
continuously deploy any changes made to the `main` branch of the repository to the Cloud Platform.

## 4. Clone the `environments` repository

To create resources on the Cloud Platform, you need to raise a pull request
against the [cloud-platform-environments] repository.

Start by checking out a copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments.git
cd cloud-platform-environments
```

## 5. Create your namespace in Cloud Platform

To create your namespace, run:

```bash
cloud-platform environment prototype create
```

You will be asked several questions, the most important of which is the name of
your prototype kit project.

This name will be used as:

* The name of the [namespace] which will be created on the cloud platform
* The name of the GitHub repository which will be created, and which will
contain your prototype kit source code
* The hostname of your prototype kit website

> You must ensure that there is not already a namespace with this name

For example, if you choose `my-prototype` as the name, you will create:

* A namespace on the Cloud Platform called `my-prototype`

...and your prototype kit website will be available at the URL:

```
https://my-prototype.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

## 6. Raise a PR

After you have answered all the questions, the cloud-platform CLI will create
several files in a folder called:

```
namespaces/live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/[name you chose]
```

> Inside this folder you'll find a `github.tf` folder, ensure that you delete this before raising pull request.

Create a new branch, `git add` the new folder and then raise a pull request.

Once a member of the Cloud Platform team has approved your PR, merge it.
