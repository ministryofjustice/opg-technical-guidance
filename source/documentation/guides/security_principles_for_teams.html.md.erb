## Trust but verify

It is important that we take a balanced approach to trust, particularly when dealing with user data. We should therefore trust our colleagues, but verify any high-risk or unusual requests. Verifying both that the request came from who we thought it did, but also that it's a reasonable request.

To achieve this:

- Cameras should by default be on during video calls, particularly during security events like incident calls or meetings with private information in
- If you receive an unusual or high risk request from an OPG Digital colleague, confirm that it with them through another channel like a video call, Slack, or Microsoft Teams
- Requests for data access or modification from OPG should come through established relationships and processes, and should involve a conversation to establish the underlying requirements

## Document your actions

We use Jira to refine and record changes that we make to our products, and the same level of documentation should be used for any access or changes to data. This ensures these actions are well-defined and well-understood, and allows us to refer back to the source of the actions in the future.

To achieve this:

- All requests for access or changes to data in our services should be recorded in Jira
- The Jira ticket should be refined as usual to ensure it is properly scoped, defined and understood by the team that owns the service
- If the action needs to change during implementation, that change should be recorded on the Jira ticket

## Minimise and revoke access

We must minimise the amount of access users have to data in our services. This starts when we give someone access to data, by ensuring they have the minimum privileges they need. We should review this privilege level for the duration of their access and ensure it is removed when they no longer need it.

To achieve this:

- Define privilege levels in services so that we can grant minimal permissions
- Teams managing services with OPG Digital users should regularly review their user list to ensure access is appropriate
- As part of the leavers process, suspend/remove user accounts from any non-SSO shared tools (e.g. Jira, Miro, Figma)
- As part of the leavers process, suspend/remove user accounts from our services (e.g. Sirius, DigiDeps Admin, Use Admin, Make Admin)
- Non-user credentials (access tokens, bot access keys) should regularly and automatically rotated
- Non-user credentials should be deauthorised and deleted as soon as they are no longer be needed

## Log all data changes

It should not be possible for data to change in a way that we cannot explain or attribute. Through source control history and tickets in Jira, we should be able to understand the cause and intention behind any data change in our services.

- All code must be in a centrally-managed source controlled repository which follow the [MOJ Repository Standards](https://operations-engineering-reports.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/repository-standards/guidance)
- As outlined in "Document your actions" above, the context to all data changes should be documented in Jira tickets
- One-off data changes to live data must require monitored escalation of privileges
- One-off data changes must leave an audit trail of when the operation was performed and by who
