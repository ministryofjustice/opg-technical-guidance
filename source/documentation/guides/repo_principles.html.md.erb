# <%= current_page.data.title %>

We want our code repositories to be as user-friendly as possible. This document is an attempt to document the idealised contents of a good repo `README.md` file as a set of principles that we can apply as a yardstick for all our code repos. Feel free to add pull requests with new ideas. 

## General Principles

Links are free. Use the README as a jumping off point to a documentation site or further markdown in the `/docs/` folder. Different products and services require different detail levels, so choose what is appropriate.
Every new starter should be asked for feedback on the repo readme to help improve it.
Keep the initial repo README short and helpful. If you go beyond 2 paragraphs in a section, consider moving the content into `/docs/` and adding a link.

## Explain what

* An intro to the service that the repo is used to build and who made it. Summarise the high level intent of the service.
1 paragraph, with links to further documentation if needed.
* Badges for currently passing build and linting/code coverage results.
* Summary of technologies used, with links to the external documentation for those tools.
* Screenshot of a working install
* Clear signposting of any OpenAPI specifications for this service and for services it makes use of.

If a larger product:

* Link to a high level architecture overview 

## Explain How

Prerequisites for building the service locally. This should be Docker for most services, but also any assumed technologies used to build and develop the app (i.e. pre-commit hooks or aws-cli)
Should contain a basic summary of how to get the service up and running for local development. 1 Paragraph, with links to more detail if needed.

* A summary of how to deploy the service, (1 Paragraph, with links to more detail if needed)
* Links to info on how to debug and test 
* Links to general development process and how you expect people to contribute.
* Link to runbooks for the service, in case a non-team member needs to provide support.
* A brief FAQ or Troubleshooting guide, preemptively answer common new developer questions.

## Legal info

A note on copyright and software license. By default this should be MIT as this is the MoJ standard.

## Things to Avoid

Our repos are open and open source, avoid putting any personally identifiable info in the `README.md` or `/docs/` folder. You can link to closed sources like confluence or google docs if needs be.

Putting too much info on the initial `README.md` and not linking out.

## Your /docs/ folder

Not everything needs to be in the `README.md`. You should move more detailed documentation into either a `/docs/` folder or for larger products a dedicated docs repo. 

```/docs/
	/architecture/
			/decisions
			/diagrams
			README.md
	/runbooks/
			DB_UPGRADE.md
	/conventions/
			LANGUAGE_STANDARDS.md
			DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md
	/openapi/
			
	README.md 
	CONTRIBUTING.md
``` 

Remember that lots of build tools can auto-generate documentation based on method comments and other sources such as PHPDOC.
