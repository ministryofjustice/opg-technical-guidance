<%= warning_text('These standards are evolving and may all change at any point') %>

Baseline API Standards for OPG teams to use when building new APIs.

Adopt these standards if there is no reason not to, but you may break any of them if you have a compelling need.

## Infrastructure

## Design

1. **Use JSON** for request and response bodies
1. **Use RFC3339** to format dates

    Examples of RFC3339 formatted dates:
     - 2023-06-16
     - 2023-06-16T09:04:38Z
     - 09:04:46Z
