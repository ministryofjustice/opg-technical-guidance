<%= warning_text('These standards are evolving and may all change at any point') %>

Baseline API Standards for OPG teams to use when building new APIs.

Adopt these standards if there is no reason not to, but you may break any of them if you have a compelling need.

## Infrastructure

## Design

1. **Use JSON** for request and response bodies
1. **Use lowerCamelCase** for keys
1. **Prefer flat structure**, we don't have a standard response format and should keep things as minimal as possible (e.g. don't use something like JSON:API, or have all responses like `{"data": ...}`)
1. **Use [RFC3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339)** to format dates

    Examples of RFC3339 formatted dates:
     - 2023-06-16
     - 2023-06-16T09:04:38Z
     - 09:04:46Z

## Versioning

1. **Avoid versioning until there is a definite requirement**
1. Use SemVer to provide meaning and context to version changes
1. Encode version in the header via Content Negotiation (`Accept` header) e.g. `Accept: application/vnd.opg-data.v1+json`
1. Prefer additive changes over destructive ones
1. Provide concrete deadlines and documentation to consumers
1. Ensure APIs and nework traffic is well-monitored
