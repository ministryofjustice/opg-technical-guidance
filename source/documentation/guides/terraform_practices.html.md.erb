## General Principals

### Repo Organisation

As a general practice across OPG we have a separation of accounts for
development, preproduction, and production; with a goal of multiple environments
in development, with preproduction and production being identical and isolated
to one environment per account.

The high level folder structure should contain an account and environment
folder, to separate out the resources. Each folder may have a sub folder for
modules relevant to that layer. VPC resources should be accessed as data
sources, and should be stored in vpc.tf within the environment directory.

```
/account
/account/modules
/environment
/environment/modules
/environment/vpc.tf
```

### Use Terraform Workspaces

We use terraform workspaces to stop the duplication and customisation of code
for each account or enviroment which increases maintainability and ease of promotion.
Workspaces allow for environments to be consistent by default, but allow features
and resources to be toggled to enable specificfunctionality.

### Usage in Pipelines

Whenever running terraform in a CI/CD pipeline always run a terraform plan stage, even
if applying with an auto-approve.  This allows you to understand exactly what terraform
changed and why should there ever be an issue, and allows traceability of when specific
changes were applied to an environment.

### Use .editorconfig in all repos for consistent whitespace

Every mainstream IDE supports plugins for the .editorconfig standard to make
it easier to enforce whitespace consistency.

We recommend adopting the whitespace convention of a particular language or project.

This is the standard `.editorconfig` that we use.

```
# Override for Makefile
[{Makefile, makefile, GNUmakefile, Makefile.*}]
indent_style = tab
indent_size = 4

[*.yaml]
intent_style = space
indent_size = 2

[*.sh]
indent_style = tab
indent_size = 4

[*.{tf,tfvars,tpl}]
indent_size = 2
indent_style = space
```

## Naming Conventions

### Resource Names

Resource names should be descriptive to allow the usage of the resource to be
easily understood.

Resources defined in terraform should be all lower case with underscores as
separators for consistency with terraform resource object names, also known as
`snake_case`. Filenames within the terraform project should also follow this
convention.

Example:

```
resource "aws_security_group" "api_ecs_task" { … }
```

Resources that exist in AWS should be all lowercase separated by hyphens,
they should all include the environment or account that they belong to in order
to determine uniqueness and to be easily identifiable in the AWS Console. Using
hyphens rather than underscores allows a resource to be easily identified as
either a terraform definition of a resource, or a “real” AWS resource.

Example:

```
resource "aws_security_group" "api_ecs" {
  name = "api-ecs-${terraform.workspace}"
}
```

## Language

### Version pin all providers

Terraform’s providers are constantly in flux. To avoid unexpected instability
we should ensure that all providers are pinned.

### Use Terraform Linting

Linting helps to ensure a consistent code formatting, improves code quality and
catches common errors with syntax.

Run `terraform fmt` before committing all code. Use a pre-commit hook to do this
automatically.

### Do not use HEREDOC for JSON, YAML or IAM Policies
There are better ways to achieve the same outcome using terraform interpolations
or resources

For JSON, use a combination of a local and the `jsonencode` function.

For YAML, use a combination of a local and the `yamlencode` function.

For IAM Policy Documents, use the native `iam_policy_document` resource.

### Use proper datatype

Using proper datatypes in terraform makes it easier to validate inputs and
document usage.

* Use null instead of empty strings ("")
* Use bool instead of strings or integers for binary true/false
* Use string for freeform text
* Use object sparingly as it makes it harder to document and validate

### Use locals to baptize opaque resource IDs

Using `locals` makes code more descriptive and maintainable.
Rather than using complex expressions as parameters to some terraform resource,
instead move that expression to a `local` and reference the `local` in the resource.

## Variables

### Use upstream module or provider variable names where applicable

When writing a module that accepts variable inputs, make sure to use the same
names as the upstream to avoid confusion and ambiguity.

### Use all lower-case with underscores as separators

Avoid introducing any other syntaxes commonly found in other languages such
as CamelCase or pascalCase. For consistency we want all variables to look uniform.
This is also inline with the [HashiCorp naming conventions][hashi-naming].

[hashi-naming]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/best-practices/naming.html

### Use positive variable names to avoid double negatives

All variable inputs that enable/disable a setting should be formatted
`...._enabled` (e.g. `encryption_enabled`).

It is acceptable for default values to be either `false` or `true`.

### Use feature flags to enable/disable functionality
All modules should incorporate feature flags to enable or disable functionality.
All feature flags should end in `_enabled` and should be of type `bool`.

### Use description field for all inputs

All `variable` inputs need a `description` field. When the field is provided by an
upstream provider (e.g. `terraform-aws-provider`), use same wording as the upstream docs.

### Use sane defaults where applicable

Modules should be as turnkey as possible. The `default` value should ensure
the most secure configuration (E.g. with encryption enabled).

### Use variables for all secrets with no default value

All `variable` inputs for secrets must never define a `default` value.
This ensures that `terraform` is able to validate user input. The exception to
this is if the secret is optional and will be generated for the user
automatically when left `null` or `""` (empty).

## Outputs

### Use description field for all outputs

All outputs must have a description set. The description should be based on
(or adapted from) the upstream terraform provider where applicable.
Avoid simply repeating the variable name as the output description.

### Use well-formatted snake case output names

Avoid introducing any other syntaxes commonly found in other languages such
as CamelCase or pascalCase. For consistency we want all variables to look uniform.
It also makes code more consistent when using outputs together with terraform
remote_state to access those settings from across modules.

### Never output secrets

Secrets should never be outputs of modules. Rather, they should be written to s
ecure storage such as AWS Secrets Manager, AWS SSM Parameter Store with KMS
encryption, or S3 with KMS encryption at rest.

Our preferred mechanism on AWS is using Secrets Manager.

### Use symmetrical names

We prefer to keep terraform outputs symmetrical as much as possible with the
upstream resource or module, with exception of prefixes. This reduces the amount
of entropy in the code or possible ambiguity, while increasing consistency.
Below is an example of what *not to do. The expected output name is `user_secret_access_key`.
This is because the other IAM user outputs in the upstream module are prefixed with `user_`,
and then we should borrow the upstream’s output name of `secret_access_key` to become
`user_secret_access_key` for consistency.

## State

### Use remote state

Use Terraform to create state bucket

This requires a two-phased approach, whereby you first provision the bucket
without the remote state enabled. Then enable remote state (e.g. s3 {}) and import
remote state by simply rerunning terraform init. We recommend this strategy
because it promotes using the best tool for the job and makes it easier to
define requirements and use consistent tooling.

### Use backend with support for state locking

We recommend using the S3 backend with DynamoDB for state locking.

### Use encrypted S3 bucket with versioning, encryption and strict IAM policies

We recommend not commingling state in the same bucket. This could cause the
state to get overridden or compromised. Note, the state contains cached values
of all outputs.

### Use .gitignore to exclude terraform state files, state directory backups and core dumps

```
.terraform
.terraform.tfstate.lock.info
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
```

## Module Design

### Small Opinionated Modules

We believe that modules should do one thing very well. But in order to do that,
it requires being opinionated on the design. Simply wrapping terraform
resources for the purposes of modularizing code is not that helpful.
Implementing a specific use-case of those resource is more helpful.
