Baseline coding standards for OPG that teams can customise and adapt to their needs, starting from a common point

## Standards

- Code should conform to recognised style guides or standards, and take advantage of automatic style checkers, linters, and static analysis tools
- Project structures should follow the conventions of the language and frameworks used
- Favour clear variable and function names over acronyms, abbreviations and explanations in comments (and donâ€™t assume technical and business domain knowledge)
- Favour open standards over proprietary or customised ones
- Any information or user interactable parts of the system must be Accessible

Code should be:

- Readable
- Correct, clear, and concise - in that order
- Tested, automatically and with easily visible measures of what is covered
- Secure, and make use of automated tools like dependency scanners
- Maintained; addressing emerging user feedback, with libraries and kept up to date, and agreed pattern changes applied consistently across the application
- Observable, with adequate logging, tracing, metrics and alerts. To understand the state of the system, be aware of issues, and see the impact of changes
- Commented where it aids understanding and good naming cannot solve this
- Appropriately performant and scalable
- Documented (with clarity on what documentation goes where and adequate signposting)
- Open by default (With the MoJ Copyright version of the MIT Licence)
