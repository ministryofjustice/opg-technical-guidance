The majority of our Joiners/Movers/Leavers processes can be carried out by using the opg-org-infra Terraform to assign permissions. Some tools like Jira or product specific admin tools may require additional work. In general the JML process will be a combiantion of Delivery Manager and WebOps work.

##Joiners##

New development or webops team members will need:

- GitHub Access
- AWS Access
- Membership of their delivery teams GitHub team
- Access to Jira and Confluence
- Any team specific admin tool access needed in their role.

##Movers##

When staff move between teams remember to:

- Move their GitHub team memberships
- Remove product level AWS access.
- Remove any team specific access to GDS services like Gov.uk Notify or Gov.uk Pay
- Close any PRs

If they are moving to another part of MOJ, this should be treated as leavers and follow below:

##Leavers##

- Remove GitHub memberships and close any open PRs
- Remove AWS access
- Remove Jira and Confluence access
- Remove any team-specific product admin tool access 
- Remove any team specific access to GDS services like Gov.uk Notify or Gov.uk Pay

If leaving MOJ as a whole:

- Make sure Digital account shutdown is followed via Service Now
- Ensure Laptop return is followed
