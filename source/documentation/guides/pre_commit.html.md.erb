# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Project teams utilise `pre-commit` functionality to handle tasks like linting - where possible we use well established open source versions of these.

Where there is a more bespoke need, we do create a repository within MoJ org on github for that purpose.

## Current OPG Hooks

- [OPG Pre Commit Hooks](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-pre-commit-hooks/)*


## Installation

For mac, install via homebrew:

```bash
brew install pre-commit
```

For other platforms check the [project website guide](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

## Conventions

We publish hooks in their own repository by default, but if you are working on multiple, functionally-related, hooks we do combine those. These can be judgement calls, so please discuss with the community if its not clear.

Naming of the repository should be descriptive enough to understand its function easily. For example, a hook which trims whitespace from twig files should be a named along the lines of `opg-pre-commit-twig-trim-whitespace`.

If you then wanted to add another hook which converted tabs in twig files to whitespace, then the repository name should be updated to match the functional scope.

Please ensure your repository contains a [readme based on our principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sKFwuunO1qUtS7_sVKnD_3MuyvdmjTOum-C_C3c8HlI/view), appropriate license file (MIT for open source) and contribution guide.


## Ownership

We do need to ensure that our code is maintained and relevant -  ownership is a cruical part of that process.


\* Requires renaming based on communitty conventions determined after creation
