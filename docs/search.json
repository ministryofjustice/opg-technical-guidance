The actors can also view the LPA summary themselves.\nIf an LPA has instructions and preferences, these are also available to view online.

Dockerhub Authentication\nThis runbook shows how to setup and use “service” DockerIDs to service CircleCI builds.\nPlease use Github Actions instead of CircleCI\nContext\nas of 1st november 2020, anonymous pulls for docker images will be rate limited to 100 per 6 hours. There are higher rates for personal accounts and unlimited pulls for organisational accounts. See:\n\n\nScaling Docker to Serve Millions More Developers: Network Egress\nAuthenticate with Docker to avoid impact of Nov. 1st rate limits\n\nThis will significantly hamper our ability to run builds in CircleCI without action. in order to resolve this, CircleCI recommends adding docker hub authentication.\n\n\nsee Using Docker Authenticated Pulls\n\nFortunately, we have access to a DockerHub organisation in the Ministry of Justice, which has free unlimited pulls of images.\nSecurity\nWe are not using CircleCI contexts as this is a shared organisational level construct, that any pipeline could use.\nWe’re not set up with context restrictions or groups in CircleCI at time of writing.\nWe need to ensure that each of the circleci projects has an individual DockerID and token added in project level environment variables, reducing blast radius should it become compromised.\nPrerequisites\nYou will need:\n\n\nYour own Docker ID, which has been:\n\n\nAdded to the ministryofjustice dockerhub organisation as an owner.\nadded to the opgdockerhubusers team.\n\nAccess to the OPG webops team google group email.\nAccess to the project settings on the CircleCI project you are working on.\n\nAsk one of your webops colleagues to help if you don’t have details of these.\nSteps\nthere are 3 main steps:\n\n\nCreate a service Docker ID\nAdd service user to docker organisation and team\nAdd docker hub credentials to CircleCI\n\n1. Create a service Docker ID\n\n\nOn hub.docker.com create a Docker ID, using:\n\n\nA strong randomised password\nA name that makes sense for the pipeline.\nThe email associated with OPG Webops Google Group, using a + email alias to associate with the new Docker ID.\n\nTake note of the above credentials and store in the webops secure vault for safekeeping.\nLog out of hub.docker.com.\nThis will send a validation email to the opg team google group, but look out for one with the correct alias.\nValidate the email.\nOnce validated successfully, log back in with the new credentials\nGo to the profile name, drop down to Account Settings and select Security on the screen.\nIn the Access Tokens click New Access Token.\nGive the token a useful name e.g. CircleCI access token and click Create\nOn the next dialog, copy the access token provided.\nPaste into the relevant secure vault entry for safekeeping.\nClick Copy and Close.\n\n2. Add the service account to organisation and team\n\n\nLog in to your own DockerID on hub.docker.com.\nunder Organisations click ministryofjustice and then click Add Member\nEnter the DockerID of the new service user and select opgdockerhubusers from the dropdown\nClick Add.\n\nThis user will have Member permissions, which will be enough to pull images. No higher permission level should be set.\n3. Add dockerhub credentials to a CircleCI Project\n\n\nCreate AWS Secrets Manager secrets for the DockerID and access token in your product’s module in opg-org-infra. Our intention is to create these secrets in the opg-management AWS account.\nmodule \"ci_dockerhub_secrets\" {\n  source         = \"../modules/ci_dockerhub_secrets\"\n  product_prefix = \"the_name_of_the_product_to_namespace_secrets\"\n  providers      = { aws = aws.management }\n}\noutput \"aws_secretsmanager_secret_dockerhub_id\" {\n  value = module.ci_dockerhub_secrets.aws_secretsmanager_secret_dockerhub_id\n}\noutput \"aws_secretsmanager_secret_dockerhub_token\" {\n  value = module.ci_dockerhub_secrets.aws_secretsmanager_secret_dockerhub_token\n}\n\nUse the aws_secretsmanager_secret_version data source to provide the secret string as an environment variable to CircleCI. You can use the opg-org-infra repository module to create environment variables for CircleCI. Applying this module will set a value of default for each secret, to be replaced later.\ndata \"aws_secretsmanager_secret_version\" \"product_dockerhub_id\" {\n  secret_id = module.product.aws_secretsmanager_secret_dockerhub_id.id\n  provider  = aws.management\n}\n\ndata \"aws_secretsmanager_secret_version\" \"product_dockerhub_token\" {\n  secret_id = module.product.aws_secretsmanager_secret_dockerhub_token.id\n  provider  = aws.management\n}\n\nmodule \"product\" {\n  source         = \"./modules/repository\"\n  name           = \"product\"\n  ...\n  circleci_env_vars = {\n    DOCKER_USER           = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.product_dockerhub_id.secret_string\n    DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN   = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.product_dockerhub_token.secret_string\n\nWhen the secrets have been created, the value of each can be set from the command line with aws-cli\naws-vault exec management -- aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --secret-id product_prefix-dockerhub_id --secret-string 'somesecretstringvalue'\naws-vault exec management -- aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --secret-id product_prefix-dockerhub_token --secret-string 'somesecretstringvalue'\nAlternatively, these values can be set in Secrets Manager in the AWS console.\nOnce these are set, rerun the build workflow on opg-org-infra’s master branch in CircleCI to update your project settings.\n\n4. Adding Docker Authenticated Pulls to CircleCI jobs\n\n\nCircleCI pulls for executors should be updated to include auth details.\nexecutors:\n  puppeteer:\n    docker:\n      - image: buildkite/puppeteer\n        auth:\n          username: $DOCKER_USER\n          password: $DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN\n    resource_class: small\n\nUse the docker orb to create a command that installs the credential helper and completes a docker login.\norbs:\n  path-to-live:\n    orbs:\n      docker: circleci/docker@1.4.0\n    commands:\n      dockerhub_login:\n        steps:\n          - docker/install-docker-credential-helper\n          - docker/check:\n              docker-password: DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN\n              docker-username: DOCKER_USER\n\nDocker pulls inside your jobs can then be authorised just prior to any step that will attempt a docker pull. For example,\ndocker_build_front_app:\n  executor: python\n  steps:\n    - checkout\n    - setup_remote_docker:\n        version: 19.03.12\n        docker_layer_caching: false\n    - dockerhub_login\n    - run:\n        name: Build\n        command: docker build --file ./docker/app/Dockerfile --tag front-app:latest .\n\n\nMore information available at using Docker Authenticated Pulls and circleci/docker orb\n","url":"/documentation/guides/circleci_dockerhub.html"},"29":{"title":"Security in our Process","content":"Security in our Process\nOur aim is to make our products as secure as possible while maintaining usability for end users.

This relates to service standard point 14, Operate a Reliable Service\nYour business continuity strategy should be:\n\n\nAppropriate and proportionate to the needs of the service and its users\nSupportable by the delivery team\nAgreed with the business\nDocumented (usually as part of your service’s GitHub repo)\n\nConversations around business continuity should include the Business, Product, Delivery, Developers, WebOps and Technical Architecture.\nWhat to look at during the Discovery / Alpha Stage\nDuring alpha and discovery phases you should be experimenting and testing your hypothesis. Business continuity work will be light touch at this stage. You should identify and understand what is proportional and appropriate for your product’s business continuity.\nGood questions to ask include:\n\n\nWhat is the impact of this proposed service failing on users and the business?\nWhat risks exist that you need to find mitigations for?\nWhich data will be key to your service functioning?\nWhich data only exists in your service?\nWhat are the business and user expectations around response and recovery?\nWhat non-digital fallbacks are in place already?\n\nAnswering these will help identify areas to build on in later phases.\nWhat to look at during Beta Stage\nDuring private and public beta stages you should focus on how your business continuity needs will impact the MVP build and how you can avoid issues in the future.\nDuring beta you should:\n\n\nIdentify how your service is likely to fail and which components are the greatest risk \nIdentify how any disaster recovery will impact how you build your infrastructure\nDefine recovery point objective and recovery time objective for your service\nIdentify who owns any business continuity processes inside and outside the delivery team\nDocument any disaster recovery in /docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md\nEnsure you have a backup and restore process for key data assets\nBuild familiarity with the incident management tools\nIdentify if your service is dependent on other systems and how much it can operate without them\nIdentify defensive coding and architectural practices to avoid or reduce dependencies\n\nFor Live products\nYou should document your support practices, disaster recovery plan and approaches before live assessment. However, you may have inherited a live codebase and need to bring it up to current standards.\n\n\nDo you need to retrofit a business continuity strategy for the product?\nHow regularly are you testing your Disaster Recovery plan?\nIs ownership of the Disaster Recovery plan clear?\nAre the team familiar with the incident management tools?\nHave any of the business needs, user needs or contacts changed?\n\nDifferences between internal-facing and external-facing services\nRequirements for recovery time (how quickly things are working again) and recovery point (what data is brought back) are different across different products and service areas depending on who uses them and the impact, both internally and externally of any downtime.\nFor example, downtime on a flagship service like Make An LPA has both impact to users and the business, but also reputational impact.\nSome products are the canonical source of truth for data in the OPG ecosystem. Others could be rebuilt from other sources. This will have a large impact on what a proportional plan is for your service.\nSome products are essential to the core work of the business and their failure has a large cost implication if staff aren’t able to work.\nFor example, downtime to Sirius has an impact on connected digital services and on the ability of core business functions. Whereas downtime for Complete the Deputy Report is inconvenient, but can be managed through good communication with users and stakeholders.\n","url":"/documentation/guides/business_continuity.html"},"33":{"title":"Repo Readme Principles","content":"Repo Readme Principles\nWe want our code repositories to be as user-friendly as possible.

We use many open source libraries written by 3rd parties to provide functionality in our apps. In PHP we use composer to install these external libraries and we have similar tools for node, python and golang.\nThe last few years have seen an uptick in security attacks using trusted dependencies and weak security in the management of package ecosystems to compromise applications. Node, PHP and Python have all had high profile compromises, we’ve been very fortuante to not be using the packages affected.\nSecurity is not the only issue though, some languages lean more into the working practice of grabbing any dependency rather than fully assessing if you need it. This can lead to long term maintenence churn on packages providing very simple functionality or bringing in a massive node package download to the frontend to achieve something simple provided by in-browser functionality. Both of which can create work we don’t need.\nThis guidance is to formalise the rules of thumb used to choose externally provided libraries to ensure we reduce the risk of a compromised package and minimise our maintenence burden.\nNew Libraries and Dependencies Guidance\n1. Question if you need an external dependency\nWe need to balance not-reinventing the wheel with taking on a support and security burden. “Would it take longer than a day to write the thing yourself?” is a good question to ask. It’s worth taking the time to research how difficult that would be. You have the chance to do some learning and development in an area, which you can share and builds the whole team’s experience. Maybe that’s better than outsourcing the knowledge and approach to a 3rd party?\nEqually, it could be an area that’s complex and requires detailed specialist knowledge to work in, such as security, interoperability with closed source code or detailed understanding of standards. In these cases letting somebody else do the work is advisable as time, effort and specialist knowledge take time to acquire.\nAnother question to ask before writing your own code is “will it take longer than a day to maintain?” Just because you understand it now doesn’t mean you’ll understand it in a year. If you write it yourself who handles ongoing support and who else understands it? Consider if it’s not application code, but really a shared library within OPG for a specific need we all share so we don’t end up copy-pasting code about.\nThe tradeoff here is essentially how much time does a 3rd party dependency save you now, versus how much time will it cost you later.\nThis article written following the incident with the colors.js library is a good explanation on reuse vs build.\n2. Always check the GitHub repo for recent activity\nYou want a library that is getting regular patches and security updates.\nYou also want a library that doesn’t change its external API every 6 months, forcing you to rework large portions of your app to accomodate it. Reading around about the library can assist you in getting a feel for this as can looking at which major version it is, be suspicious of anything lower than 1.0.0 or with flags for “not yet production ready” or “proof of concept”\nYou want a library that is compatible with the main framework you are using and any coding standards your team have in place. You also need to consider if it’s maintaining compatibility with upcoming language and framework versions. We’ve seen this with Laminas and PHP 8.1 compatibilities, for example, where there was a lag in language compatibility updates.\n3. Check that the dependency is managed by a community\nSingle contributor libraries have more chance of being compromised and nobody noticing. More eyes on changes means more chance of vandalism or malicious activity being caught earlier.\nCommunities also enforce standards and tend to mean APIs are more stable as others need to use them too. Communities supported by charitable trust (JS foundation) or big organisations (Mozilla) tend to help with ensuring maintenence, stability and backward compatibility.\nLibraries with single maintainers, even well known ones, can be subject to issues not found in larger communities, like the creator rage quitting (see node left pad) or just vanishing and the package becoming abandoned.\nThe number of open issues and how they are responded to can also be an indicator of community health. It’s worth being wary of anything with a high number of “won’t fix” type labels.\n4. Check the license on the dependency\nNot all software licenses are compatible. We use an MIT license for our open source code, so anything using that is 100% compatible.\nSome licenses may be incompatible with private storage of source code, for example due to forcing publication, which might not be appropriate to a service that requires some parts of its codebase to be private for operational reasons.\n5. Check how the library responded to any previous security incidents\nTransparency and quick reaction to any previous security issues are a good sign of how a library’s maintainers will react next time. Particularly if they have defined incident processes, public lessons learned and risk mitigations already in place.\n6. See how easy contributing is\nWe like to give back if we use things, hopefully that’s not a painful process. How easy is it for a new contributor to get a PR merged on the library? This will help if we do need to patch something upstream to gain compatibility with recent language versions.\nThis can be a downside too: what checks do you need to pass to get code added? Is it too easy? Could somebody manipulate that process?\n7. Do you need the whole thing?\nSmaller libraries are prefered to larger frameworks to avoid bringing in large amounts of code you don’t need for one class or method you do. The attack surface of a bigger project means there’s more potential for you to get an exploit in unrelated code you end up shipping anyway.\nThis is particularly an issue with frontend dependencies, don’t add 1 library with 40 sub dependencies just to do something browsers can do anyway with CSS or native APIs. The performance and usability impact of 25mb of JS just to add a hover effect should not be underestimated. Check out tools like tree-shaking in builds that can reduce this by not deploying unused codepaths.\n8. Check what the library’s own dependencies look like\nSometimes it’s not the direct dependency itself that’s the risk, but the dependencies of the dependency. It’s worth checking for further downstream projects with the same set of issues.\n9. Pin to a specific version\nIt’s always best to pin a given dependency to a specific version. So using 1.0.4 rather than a less specific ^1.0.\nWhile lock files will pin to known good versions, you might inadvertantly pull in a malicious version 1.0.5 as it becomes available as part of development changes when updating packages if you aren’t pinned.\nWe have dependabot to pull in point-version updates when they become available. For particularly volatile ecosystems (NPM/Node) it is best to wait a 3 days before merging PRs for non-security related updates to allow time for malicious activity to be detected.\nSome teams have experimented with automerging patch updates. If you do this it’s worth automating the 3 day wait, particularly if your app is node based. Critical security updates are worth considering in isolation, as it may be that you are at greater risk leaving it unpatched for 3 days than the patch itself being bad. A check of the upstream commits for tampering can help make decisions on this.\n10. Look for opportunities to refactor out dependencies\nNot all our code bases are new (Sirius and Make at now 8 years old in places). As such it’s always worth being on the lookout for dependencies that were good at time of implementation, but have since fallen behind or lost support. It’s always good to reassess the value of a given dependency, in some cases the core language or framework will have moved on and now provide functionality natively. A good example of this is jQuery, where a decade ago you needed its selector engine, but now the web platform provides document.querySelectorAll()`. In general do this at least every 6 months.\nPay particular attention for the warnings of “no longer supported” that package managers will provide.\n","url":"/documentation/guides/dependencies.html"},"35":{"title":"OPG Terraform Practices","content":"OPG Terraform Practices\nGeneral Principles\nSimple is better than Complex - Code for readability and inheritability\nLayers of loops, dynamic blocks, and ternaries obscure what it is you’re actually\ndoing, making it difficult to work with for junior engineers, you in 12 months time\nor people trying to get an understanding of Terraform.\nCode should be correct, clear and concise, in that order.\nRepo Organisation\nAs a general practice across OPG we have a separation of accounts for\ndevelopment, preproduction, and production; with a goal of multiple environments\nin development, with preproduction and production being identical and isolated\nto one environment per account.\nThe high level folder structure should contain an account and environment\nfolder, to separate out the resources. Each folder may have a sub folder for\nmodules relevant to that layer. VPC resources should be accessed as data\nsources, and should be stored in vpc.tf within the environment directory.\n/account\n/account/modules\n/environment\n/environment/modules\n/environment/vpc.tf\nUse Terraform Workspaces\nWe use Terraform workspaces to stop the duplication and customisation of code\nfor each account or enviroment which increases maintainability and ease of promotion.\nWorkspaces allow for environments to be consistent by default, but allow features\nand resources to be toggled to enable specificfunctionality.\nUsage in Pipelines\nWhenever running Terraform in a CI/CD pipeline always run a terraform plan stage, even\nif applying with an auto-approve.  This allows you to understand exactly what Terraform\nchanged and why should there ever be an issue, and allows traceability of when specific\nchanges were applied to an environment.\nUse .editorconfig in all repos for consistent whitespace\nEvery mainstream IDE supports plugins for the .editorconfig standard to make\nit easier to enforce whitespace consistency.\nWe recommend adopting the whitespace convention of a particular language or project.\nThis is the standard .editorconfig that we use.\n# Override for Makefile\n[{Makefile, makefile, GNUmakefile, Makefile.*}]\nindent_style = tab\nindent_size = 4\n\n[*.yaml]\nintent_style = space\nindent_size = 2\n\n[*.sh]\nindent_style = tab\nindent_size = 4\n\n[*.{tf,tfvars,tpl}]\nindent_size = 2\nindent_style = space\nNaming Conventions\nResource Names\nResource names should be descriptive to allow the usage of the resource to be\neasily understood.\nResources defined in Terraform should be all lowercase with underscores as\nseparators for consistency with Terraform resource object names, also known as\nsnake_case. Filenames within the Terraform project should also follow this\nconvention.\nExample:\nresource \"aws_security_group\" \"api_ecs_task\" { … }\nResources that exist in AWS should be all lowercase separated by hyphens,\nthey should all include the environment or account that they belong to in order\nto determine uniqueness and to be easily identifiable in the AWS Console. Using\nhyphens rather than underscores allows a resource to be easily identified as\neither a Terraform definition of a resource, or a “real” AWS resource.\nExample:\nresource \"aws_security_group\" \"api_ecs\" {\n  name = \"api-ecs-${terraform.workspace}\"\n}\nLanguage\nVersion pin all providers\nTerraform’s providers are constantly in flux. To avoid unexpected instability\nwe should ensure that all providers are pinned.\nUse Terraform Linting\nLinting helps to ensure a consistent code formatting, improves code quality and\ncatches common errors with syntax.\nRun terraform fmt before committing all code. Use a pre-commit hook to do this\nautomatically.\nDo not use HEREDOC for JSON, YAML or IAM Policies\nThere are better ways to achieve the same outcome using Terraform interpolations\nor resources\nFor JSON, use a combination of a local and the jsonencode function.\nFor YAML, use a combination of a local and the yamlencode function.\nFor IAM Policy Documents, use the native iam_policy_document resource.\nUse proper datatype\nUsing proper datatypes in Terraform makes it easier to validate inputs and\ndocument usage.\n\n\nUse null instead of empty strings (“”)\nUse bool instead of strings or integers for binary true/false\nUse string for freeform text\nUse object sparingly as it makes it harder to document and validate\n\nUse locals to baptize opaque resource IDs\nUsing locals makes code more descriptive and maintainable.\nRather than using complex expressions as parameters to some Terraform resource,\ninstead move that expression to a local and reference the local in the resource.\nVariables\nUse upstream module or provider variable names where applicable\nWhen writing a module that accepts variable inputs, make sure to use the same\nnames as the upstream to avoid confusion and ambiguity.\nUse all lowercase with underscores as separators\nAvoid introducing any other syntaxes commonly found in other languages such\nas CamelCase or pascalCase. For consistency we want all variables to look uniform.\nThis is also inline with the HashiCorp naming conventions.\nUse positive variable names to avoid double negatives\nAll variable inputs that enable/disable a setting should be formatted\n...._enabled (e.g. encryption_enabled).\nIt is acceptable for default values to be either false or true.\nUse feature flags to enable/disable functionality\nAll modules should incorporate feature flags to enable or disable functionality.\nAll feature flags should end in _enabled and should be of type bool.\nUse description field for all inputs\nAll variable inputs need a description field. When the field is provided by an\nupstream provider (e.g. terraform-aws-provider), use same wording as the upstream docs.\nUse sane defaults where applicable\nModules should be as turnkey as possible. The default value should ensure\nthe most secure configuration (E.g. with encryption enabled).\nUse variables for all secrets with no default value\nAll variable inputs for secrets must never define a default value.\nThis ensures that terraform is able to validate user input. The exception to\nthis is if the secret is optional and will be generated for the user\nautomatically when left null or \"\" (empty).\nOutputs\nUse description field for all outputs\nAll outputs must have a description set. The description should be based on\n(or adapted from) the upstream Terraform provider where applicable.\nAvoid simply repeating the variable name as the output description.\nUse well-formatted snake case output names\nAvoid introducing any other syntaxes commonly found in other languages such\nas CamelCase or pascalCase. For consistency we want all variables to look uniform.\nIt also makes code more consistent when using outputs together with Terraform\nremote_state to access those settings from across modules.\nNever output secrets\nSecrets should never be outputs of modules. Rather, they should be written to \nsecure storage such as AWS Secrets Manager, AWS SSM Parameter Store with KMS\nencryption, or S3 with KMS encryption at rest.\nOur preferred mechanism on AWS is using Secrets Manager.\nUse symmetrical names\nWe prefer to keep Terraform outputs symmetrical as much as possible with the\nupstream resource or module, with exception of prefixes. This reduces the amount\nof entropy in the code or possible ambiguity, while increasing consistency.\nBelow is an example of what *not to do. The expected output name is user_secret_access_key.\nThis is because the other IAM user outputs in the upstream module are prefixed with user_,\nand then we should borrow the upstream’s output name of secret_access_key to become\nuser_secret_access_key for consistency.\nState\nUse remote state\nUse Terraform to create state bucket\nThis requires a two-phased approach, whereby you first provision the bucket\nwithout the remote state enabled. Then enable remote state (e.g. s3 {}) and import\nremote state by simply rerunning terraform init. We recommend this strategy\nbecause it promotes using the best tool for the job and makes it easier to\ndefine requirements and use consistent tooling.\nUse backend with support for state locking\nWe recommend using the S3 backend with DynamoDB for state locking.\nUse encrypted S3 bucket with versioning, encryption and strict IAM policies\nWe recommend not commingling state in the same bucket. This could cause the\nstate to get overridden or compromised. Note, the state contains cached values\nof all outputs.\nUse .gitignore to exclude Terraform state files, state directory backups and core dumps\n.terraform\n.terraform.tfstate.lock.info\n*.tfstate\n*.tfstate.backup\nModule Design\nSmall Opinionated Modules\nWe believe that modules should do one thing very well. But in order to do that,\nit requires being opinionated on the design. Simply wrapping Terraform\nresources for the purposes of modularizing code is not that helpful.\nImplementing a specific use-case of those resource is more helpful.\n","url":"/documentation/guides/terraform_practices.html"},"36":{"title":"OPG Terraform Modules","content":"OPG Terraform Modules\nScope\nThis guide will set out when \u0026 how we should use Terraform modules.\nOverview\nModules in Terraform are self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that are managed as a group.

The primary data representation in REST is a resource, which is a mapping to a set of entities. This dictates how REST APIs should be designed and the following princples should guide how the resources are addressed:\n\n\nResources are represented by nouns. Resource names can be “real” nouns or abstract collections e.g. /users or /user-management.\nA resource can be a singleton or a collection. Collections are pluralised and singletons are addressed by ID. e.g. /users/1, where users is a collection and 1 is the singleton.\nResources are hierarchical, with resources containing other resources. These relationships are denoted with forward slashes. e.g. /teams/1/users/2.\nA URI addresses the resource, not the action. HTTP methods should be used to indicate the action being performed. e.g. HTTP POST /users, not /users/create.\nUse query parameters to filter a resource collection instead of creating a new URI. e.g. /users?role=admin.\nUse hyphens to improve readability. Avoid underscores and other separators. e.g. /device-management/os-versions.\nUse lower case only. Case sensitivity is dependent on the browser, server, and host OS, so mixed-case should be avoided.\nDo not use file extensions in URIs. If this information needs to be communicated, use the Content-Type header.\n\nAlthough we should strive to follow the standard as best practice wherever possible, there are situations where this isn’t possible, e.g. executing scripts via an API call. In these instances, it is necessary to provide adequate documentation so consumers are aware it is not addressing a resource.\nVersioning\n\n\nAvoid versioning until there is a definite requirement\nUse SemVer to provide meaning and context to version changes\nEncode version in the header via Content Negotiation (Accept header) e.g. Accept: application/vnd.opg-data.v1+json\nPrefer additive changes over destructive ones\nProvide concrete deadlines and documentation to consumers\nEnsure APIs and network traffic is well-monitored\n\nFor further information, see the OPG Data versioning strategy\nDocumentation\n\n\nUse the OpenAPI Specification for documenting APIs\n\n\nThis may be used by your API’s consumers to automatically generate mocks using tools like Prism\n\nStore in the repo at /docs/openapi/openapi.yml\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nUse JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate requests between OPG services\n\n\nEach JWT must contain the following claims:\n\n\nsub: Either an identifier of the user making the request (e.g. email address) or a service identifier if not user is involved\niat: The timestamp of when the token was issued\nexp: The timestamp of when the token will expire\niss: The service that issued the token\n\nAPIs must validate “exp”, “iat” and “iss” claims, and the “nbf” claim if provided\n\nWhere APIs only have consumers inside OPG, use infrastructure tools (e.g. AWS IAM) to restrict access to those services\n\nPerformance\n\n\nWe have no departmental performance requirements, but you should discuss as a team if you can set any for yourselves.\nMonitor realtime performance of your production services with the tools provided by AWS, such as CloudWatch Metrics and X-Ray\nConsider alternative techniques for slow-running transactions such as using asynchronous request/response patterns, or queuing onerous processes to execute after the response has been sent\n\nUseful links\n\n\nAPI Working Group\n\n","url":"/documentation/guides/api_standards.html"},"41":{"title":"Architecture Decision Records","content":"Architecture Decision Records\nTo understand why we are recording decisions and how we are doing it, please see ADR-000\n\n        \n          \nStatus\nADR no.\nTitle\n\n✅\nADR-000\nRecord Architecture Decisions\n\n✅\nADR-001\nShared Library Organisation\n\n✅\nADR-002\nApplication Domain Names\n\n✅\nADR-003\nSemantic Versioning\n\n✅\nADR-004\nNo Hardware MFA\n\n✅\nADR-005\nPut Prototypes on MoJ Cloud Platform\n\n✅\nADR-006\nMigrate to Github Actions instead of CircleCI\n\n✅\nADR-007\nHealthcheck Definitions\n\n✅\nADR-008\nDeployment environments\n\n✅\nADR-009\nLog structure\n\n        \n      Statuses:\n\n\n🤔 Proposed\n✅ Accepted\n❌ Rejected\n⌛️ Superseded\n♻️  Amended\n\n","url":"/documentation/adrs.html"},"42":{"title":"Recommended Tools","content":"Recommended Tools\nWe recommend installing all the tools in this Brewfile\n# 'brew tap'\ntap \"homebrew/bundle\"\ntap \"homebrew/cask\"\ntap \"homebrew/core\"\nbrew \"vim\"\nbrew \"act\"\nbrew \"awscli\"\nbrew \"composer\"\nbrew \"curl\"\nbrew \"direnv\"\nbrew \"git\"\nbrew \"git-secrets\"\nbrew \"jq\"\nbrew \"pre-commit\"\nbrew \"terraform\"\nbrew \"tflint\"\nbrew \"tfsec\"\ncask \"aws-vault\"\ncask \"docker\"\ncask \"keybase\"\n","url":"/documentation/brew.html"},"43":{"title":"Incident Response Process","content":"Incident Response Process\nThis document describes our incident handling process (inspired by work elsewhere in MOJ like the Cloud Platform).\nConfirm that an event constitutes an incident\nWe define an incident as an event which:\n\n\nRequires immediate response to return normal service\nSeverely degrades user experience of the service\nCompromises application security, resulting in a breach or potential breach\nHas the potential for loss or compromise of data\n\nExamples:\n\n\nLive service is unreachable due to denial of service\nConnectivity to a database is down and so services cannot be accessed\nA problem in one service means another is no longer functioning e.g. api gateway in Sirius causing issues in Use An LPA\nMisconfiguration means that secrets are exposed on a live service\nUnauthorized access to an API which can result in attackers accessing data\n\nDeclare an incident\nFrom your teams channel you can use the OPG incidents Slack tool to declare an incident.\n/opg-incident Something's happened\nSlack will pop open a form to to fill in extra information.

However, this logging information is inconsitently structured. This leads to a few problems:\n\n\nIt is hard to interpret logs under standard operation, as logs from different containers with different structures are interspersed\nDuring an incident, it is hard to find related logs as the inconsistent structures require separate queries\nOur log-based alarms are complex to write and update as they have to query several different structures\n\nDecision\nWe will define a standard logging structure that all teams will use. Teams are welcome to expand on the structure by adding extra fields, but must include all required fields in each log message and must ensure not to use reserved fields for anything other than their defined usage.\nAll logs must be formatted as JSON objects.\nAn example of a minimal log message:\n{\"time\": \"2024-02-14T12:34:23Z\", \"level\": \"CRITICAL\", \"msg\": \"Null pointer exception\", \"service_name\": \"opg-example\"}\nAn example of a more complex log message:\n{\n  \"time\": \"2024-02-14T13:39:01Z\",\n  \"level\": \"INFO\",\n  \"msg\": \"User permissions updated\",\n  \"service_name\": \"opg-example\",\n  \"trace_id\": \"1-581cf771-a006649127e371903a2de979\",\n  \"request\": { \"method\": \"PUT\", \"path\": \"/user/133/permissions\" },\n  \"location\": { \"file\": \"pages/user/edit_permission.go\", \"line\": 156 },\n  \"actor_id\": 48\n}\nAs well as the required and reserved fields below, log messages can include any other fields (such as “location” and “actor_id” above).\nRequired fields\ntime must be an RFC3339-formatted date/time.\nlevel must be an RFC5424-defined log level in uppercase: EMERGENCY, ALERT, CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, NOTICE, INFO, DEBUG. Services don’t need to use every log level, but alarms and stored queries should account for them all. Whilst all log levels can be used in code, the minimum logging level should be INFO in non-dev environments.\nmsg is the free form message.\nservice_name is the name of the container or lambda outputting the log.\nReserved fields\nrequest, if provided, must be an object containing a method property of the request’s HTTP method, and a path property of the requested path. Additional properties are permitted.\ntrace_id, if provided, must be a string containing the AWS X-Ray trace ID of the orgininating request.\nConsequences\nReading logs interspersed between different services and containers will be easier as they all follow the same structure. We will be able to write common queries and alarms that work across all of our services.\nEach team will need to review their current logging instrumentation to ensure it matches this structure.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-009.html"},"52":{"title":"ADR-007 Healthcheck Definitions","content":"ADR-007 Healthcheck Definitions\nDate: 14-02-2023\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nAcross our teams there are currently slight differences in how we use the various health checks within services.\nThis is mainly in the fidelity of the checks and what they connect to. For example one service might use a health check to just check if a service’s containers are running. Another might check that in-app connectivity is working, such as front end to internal API to DB. Another might check that the service can connect out to related services it depends on, such as Notify or other API endpoints.\nThis means that an engineer moving between products, either for temporary support or moving into a new role, could be confused at the intent of the healthcheck or make assumptions based on past experience that turn out not to be true. This is particularly true if the healthcheck is used for multiple purposes which could be at odds, for example if a healthcheck connecting to an external service was used to cause containers to scale or cycle when they didn’t need to.\nDecision\nWe need to be clear on the purpose of each healthcheck within a service and be consistent across services in how we name, use and check them. Therefore we should categorise them as: container health checks, service health checks and dependency health checks so we are clear about what type we implement and how they are intended to be used. Urls given below are our standard suggestions, which teams should mvoe towards.\nContainer Health Checks\nThese are used to determine if an individual container is running as expected. Reports that the container has finished its startup and is ready to handle requests. Should start to fail if the container needs to be cycled out.\n/health-check\nService Health Checks\nThese are used to determine if a service is “up” and working for the purposes of uptime calculation and proving that end to end within a service boundary is functioning normally. That is the front end can talk to the api and the api can talk to the DB. Typically a front end service health check will talk to the api version of the same health check.\n/health-check/service\nDependency Health Checks\nThese are used to determine if a service’s external dependencies (external APIs like Notify or the Sirius integrations) are down and may cause service degredation. They should return details of each service status. A more developed version of this will also indicate what impact that service being down will have on the system. Teams shoudl take time to work out the likely impacts, for example Notify being down could just mean email is queued until it is working again.\n/health-check/dependencies\nMonitoring Health Checks\nIt is worth noting that for Route53 health checks AWS considers them unhealthy if they take longer than 4 seconds to connect and longer than 2 seconds to respond with a 200 or 3xx response. This means any health check connecting outside the service boundary (dependency health checks) are not recommended for these. See AWS documentation.\nTeams are encouraged to create other alerts consistent with the nature of their service to alert on broader service healthcheck failures. Some teams may want to use Pingdom, but this is not suitable for internal-only services behind an allowlist.\nConsequences\n\n\nWork will need to happen to normalise the various health checks across the estate.\nTeams will need to indentify what a dependency failure means for a given service and make that explicit with Product colleagues.\nWe will report Service Health Checks in any request for uptime stats.\n\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-007.html"},"53":{"title":"ADR-003 Semantic Versioning","content":"ADR-003 Semantic Versioning\nDate: 26-08-2021\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nEstablish a pattern and guidlines for versioning all of OPG Digital’s applications and services.\nDecision\nSemantic Versioning\nAll services should follow the standard for semantic versioning for their components.

See Wildcard Names\nYou should have a delegated hosted zone for each AWS Account, which becomes the domain for the primary environment\nin that account. Production will not have a account prefix and live at the root level of the services domain\nProduction example:\n[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk\nNon-Production example:\npreproduction.[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk\ndevelopment.[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk\nEphemeral Environments\nephemeral environments will live within the hosted zone of the account where the environment is created.\n[environment_name].development.[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk\nNo Abbreviations\nDont use abbreviations in domains names where possible, A products preproduction environment\nshould be:\npreproduction.[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk not ‘pre.[service_name].opg.service.justice.gov.uk’\nConsequences\nSome products might have to do some slight refactoring work, however this shouldnt effect any production domains.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-002.html"},"56":{"title":"ADR-001 Shared Library Organisation","content":"ADR-001 Shared Library Organisation\nDate: 2021-02-09\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nWe produce shared code and need to keep it well organised.\nDecision\nThe organisation of repositories for components, modules and packages produced by OPG digital’s WebOps community should be small and specific over collected and centralised.\nConsequences\nThe OPG digital Webops community could proliferate lots of small repositories that will need to be maintained, but this can be a benefit to each. It enables finer version control, tight scoping, discrete automation and reduces barriers to publication.\nNaming things is hard, and members of the community will need to keep good and relevant naming conventions to help others to find and understand the purpose of the shared code.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-001.html"},"57":{"title":"ADR-004 No Hardware MFA Key For Root Account","content":"ADR-004 No Hardware MFA Key For Root Account\nDate: 23-09-2021\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nDo not create or check for hardware MFA for “Root” account.\nDecision\nNo Hardware MFA Key for Root Account\nWith team members responsible for root account credentials not being based at a single location, a hardware MFA is impractical for emergency use.\nThe team will instead maintain software MFA devices and require their presence.\nConsequences\nThe team will instead maintain software MFA devices and require their presence.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-004.html"},"58":{"title":"ADR-008 Deployment environments","content":"ADR-008 Deployment environments\nDate: 27-11-2023\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nWhen working across multiple teams, or switching between teams, it can be hard to follow what each deployment environment is for and what practices it keeps. This can lead to data ending up in an improper environment, or tests being run with incorrect assumptions of the state of the environment.\nWe sometimes need to test, demo or explore functionality between multiple connected services. To do so, we need persistent environments of each service that are connected together. Not all products have this, and those that do can be inconsistent, making it harder to perform these activities.\nDecision\nAll services must have the following essential environments, which should be deployed sequentially as part of the path to live:\n\n\nLocal environment\nDeployment testing environment\nProduction environment\nDemo environment\n\nServices may commonly have additional environments:\n\n\nAutomatic PR environments\nManual PR environments\nPreproduction environment\nOther persistent environments\n\nProduction environment\nThis is what our users access and it contains our real data. It must be the only environment in the production account.\nDeployment testing environment\nEvery service must have at least one environment that is as close to production’s infrastructure and scale as feasible. This may contain a copy of production data and live in the preproduction account, or may contain synthetic data and live in the development account.\nIt is not accessible by the public. It is deployed in the pipeline before production to test that the release can be deployed successfully.\nDemo environment\nThis is used to test, demo and explore functionality against the currently deployed release. It is in the development account, does not contain production data and is not accessible by the public. It is deployed in the pipeline after production to ensure it reflects the latest releaase.\nIt is connected to the demo environment of any dependencies, and is the target of the demo environemnt of any dependent services. This allows cross-service testing.\nIt is be available at demo.development.{production host}.\nLocal environment\nAll services must be available to stand-up on departmental laptops in some form for local development and testing. Local environments should not require any external connections to dependent services (though their build pipeline may require external connection to e.g. fetch code and packages).\nAutomatic PR environments\nThese are created automatically when a pull request is raised to use for testing and demo of changes before they are merged. They are in the development account and are not accessible by the public.\nThese environments should be used to test against, rather than using local containerised environments on the CI runner, to provide a higher level of confidence.\nWhen the pull request is merged, the associated environment is automatically destroyed.\nThey are available at {automatically derived name}.development.{production host}\nManual PR environments\nIn some services it may be impractical to automatically create environments for every pull request. In this case, it should be possible to manually create an environment based on the pull request. These environments should have a “deletion date” on creation and automatically be destroyed when that date is passed.\nThey are available at {manually or automatically derived name}.development.{production host}\nIn all other regards, they are the same as automatic PR environments.\nPreproduction environment\nThis has identical infrastructure and data to the production environment though is not connected to external services. It is in the preproduction account and is not accesible to the public.\nIt is used to test against a real data set, where synthetic data is not reflective or large enough to provide confidence. It may the deployment testing environment and deployed to as part of the main pipeline, or be deployed to manually whe needed.\nIt is be available at preproduction.{production host}.\nOther persistent environments\nSome services may require other persistent environments. For example, for training or user research. These environments may be created automatically or manually, depending on the team’s needs.\nThese environments are in the development account and do not contain production data.\nConsequences\nHaving more consistent environment practices will make developing and maintaining services across multiple teams more predictable and less prone to confusion. Having consistent demo environments will make cross-service testing easier and safer.\nThis will be more challenging for services that make exceptions to this decision, as they might lead to incorrect assumptions. Service teams will need to clearly document their exceptions and explanations to avoid confusion.\nWhere services connect to each other, teams must document which environments are connected and what type of data (production, pseudonymised etc.) each uses. This is essential to ensure that private data does not incorrectly cross tiers.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-008.html"},"59":{"title":"ADR-006 Migrate to Github Actions instead of CircleCI","content":"ADR-006 Migrate to Github Actions instead of CircleCI\nDate: 14-02-2023\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nCircleCI has been in use at OPG since 2018 and was our primary CI/CD tool for much of that time. It has been handling builds and deployments for all of our major services and code bases - including core items like opg-org-infra. However, after trailing GitHub Actions, which has organically grown to become our most widely used CI/CD tool, it is a suitable time to reassess our support and usage of CircleCI.\nAs GitHub Actions is an additional feature of GitHub - our primary code repository host - it is exceptionally well integrated with our code bases and offers a range of features that CircleCI does not support:\n\n\nDifferential between a variable whose content should be seen as privileged or not (via secrets) and when using a secret the information is masked / redacted\nMore granular access control for secrets / environment variables. They can be scope to individual steps to reduce risk of exfiltration (such as Codecov incident).\nWorkflow permissions to restrict what can happen within the pipeline (eg read only access)\nNative OIDC support to further harden our infrastruture access\nEasier sharing of common tasks via reusable workflows.\n\nCircleCI also had a concering security breach, which took a lot of effort to mitigate.\nDecision\nAll future projects, with the exception of Sirius related ones, will utilise GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Sirius projects will remain on Jenkins until the build overhead can be suitably reduced.\nMigrate historical projects over as and when possible.\nUpdate terraform modules to remove CircleCI functionality in future versions to encourage this migration.\nConsequences\nAny existing projects still on CircleCI will need to be migrated. While migrating, ensure correct secret usage. Reduce scope / access to both as much as possible with external workflows.\nCheck all runbooks are up to date and reference usage of GitHub or CircleCI accurately.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-006.html"},"60":{"title":"ADR-005 Put prototypes on the MOJ Cloud Platform","content":"ADR-005 Put prototypes on the MOJ Cloud Platform\nDate: 26-11-2021\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nWe have various prototypes of none-live services stored in GitHub that need to be shared with internal and external stakeholders in a usable form.\nPreviously we had prototypes scattered on various un-manmaged Heroku instances, sitting in either personal or organisation accounts of without clear control. This has made tracking ownership and deployment harder as time went on, particularly where projects have paused or had time between prototype work and new people needed access.\nGiven that the MOJ Cloud PLatform can host things easily and provides tooling to enable it easily, it makes sense to use it to host any prototypes produced for OPG Digital.\nDecision\nHost any prototypes for new services on MOJ Cloud PLatform.\nConsequences\nAny existing prototypes should be moved off Heroku and redirects put in place to their new location. The Heroku redirect repo provides code for this. Cost of using this hosting will need to be recharged.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-005.html"}}}
