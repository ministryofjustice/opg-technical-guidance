Set up your GitHub account\n\n\nSet up a GitHub account. Existing personal accounts are fine to use.\nAsk #ask-operations-engineering to add you to the ministryofjustice organisation. You will have to be added to the OPG team to get access to repos. Remember to click accept in the GitHub email invitation.\nGenerate and register an SSH key pair for your laptop for your GitHub account. You should use a 4096 bit key.\nWhile you are here, associate your name and email to your git commits:\n$ git config --global user.email \"friendly.giraffe@digital.justice.gov.uk\"\n$ git config --global user.name \"Friendly Giraffe\"\n\n\n3. Get AWS access\nTo work with products and services at OPG, you will require an account in AWS.\nRequest an account\nAWS accounts are all managed in code using terraform.\nThey are defined in the opg-org-infa repository, If you have been\nput into the OPG team on GitHub, your AWS account would have been created at the same time.\nAsk your team’s DevOps engineer to set your password.\nSign in to AWS\nTo sign in, go to the OPG AWS Sign page, and use the following credentials:\n\n\n“Account ID or alias”: opg-identity\nUsername: firstname.lastname\nPassword: your password\n\nSet up your MFA\nYou have to set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).\n\n\nSign in to AWS account\nSelect or go to IAM service.\nClick on “Users” in the menu bar on the left hand side\nEnter your name\nClick on the link for your name\nClick on the security credentials tab\nClick on the “Manage” link next to “Assigned MFA device”\nFollow the steps to set up your MFA device\nNB: The “Device name” needed for the MFA will need to link to your identity.\nIt should look something like firstname.surname-authy\nLog out and log back into your AWS account\n\nGet the appropriate access\nAn account in AWS does not give you access to anything, you’ll need to be given rights.\nAsk your teams DevOps engineer to pair with you on getting the appropriate access.\n4. Set up AWS Roles\nIdentity is the account where your user identity is stored, but there are no usable resources in this account.\nTo perform useful work, you will need to switch up to a role in another account.\nSee the AWS docs for detailed information on how to do this.\nHere is a small diagram that explains what each role is for:\n\nRole switching\nThe AWS console now supports signing into multiple accounts.\nAlternatively, you can use the\naws-extend-switch-roles Chrome extension. You will be able to add the roles you require into the plugin.\nIf you intend to use the CLI then you will need to\nset up role profiles in your AWS config file.\nAll the roles can be found here\n5.

Repository Handover\nDate: 26-04-2024\nStatus\n🤔 Proposed\nContext\nWith movement in teams, changes in team makeup and the ownership of components over time, teams have often had to take up ownership of code repositories that they did not originate. This can lead to issues if the code follows unfamiliar patterns or is in a different langauge to the one currently used by a team.\nDecision\nIf the ownership of an opg code repository changes, the team who currently has ownership has a responsibility to conduct a handover meeting. Before which they should check that:\n\n\nthe readme gives a clear introduction to the code, its purpose, testing and deployment pipeline\nall runbooks are up to date and correct\nany other documentation including diagrams are up to date and correct\n\nMaking sure all docs are up to date should make any future handover easier with each iteration.\nThe handover meeting should then be a point of exchange of ownership, giving the new team a chance to ask questions. The agenda should cover:\n\n\nAn introduction to the repository\nDiscussion of any gotchas and how the repo might diverge from expectations\nA questions and answers session for the new team\n\nWebOps will only change the repository code owners to the new team and update the ownership metadata once this meeting has taken place.\nSome repos may have been historically managed by teams who are no longer within the business. In which case it is the responsibility of the business area technical architect to prepare the handover meeting to the best of their ability and digital archaeology skills. In this case new teams should make checking the readme and documentation a priority.\nConsequences\nWe will not have situations where teams have inherited code repositories they do not understand.\nThere is additional overhead to the handover process and handover must be explicit.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-010.html"},"23":{"title":"ADR-004 No Hardware MFA Key For Root Account","content":"ADR-004 No Hardware MFA Key For Root Account\nDate: 23-09-2021\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nDo not create or check for hardware MFA for “Root” account.\nDecision\nNo Hardware MFA Key for Root Account\nWith team members responsible for root account credentials not being based at a single location, a hardware MFA is impractical for emergency use.\nThe team will instead maintain software MFA devices and require their presence.\nConsequences\nThe team will instead maintain software MFA devices and require their presence.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-004.html"},"24":{"title":"ADR-000 Record Architecture Decisions","content":"ADR-000 Record Architecture Decisions\nDate: 2020-12-01\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nWe need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.\nDecision\nWe will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions\nConsequences\nSee Michael Nygard’s article, linked above.

For example one service might use a health check to just check if a service’s containers are running. Another might check that in-app connectivity is working, such as front end to internal API to DB. Another might check that the service can connect out to related services it depends on, such as Notify or other API endpoints.\nThis means that an engineer moving between products, either for temporary support or moving into a new role, could be confused at the intent of the healthcheck or make assumptions based on past experience that turn out not to be true. This is particularly true if the healthcheck is used for multiple purposes which could be at odds, for example if a healthcheck connecting to an external service was used to cause containers to scale or cycle when they didn’t need to.\nDecision\nWe need to be clear on the purpose of each healthcheck within a service and be consistent across services in how we name, use and check them. Therefore we should categorise them as: container health checks, service health checks and dependency health checks so we are clear about what type we implement and how they are intended to be used. Urls given below are our standard suggestions, which teams should mvoe towards.\nContainer Health Checks\nThese are used to determine if an individual container is running as expected. Reports that the container has finished its startup and is ready to handle requests. Should start to fail if the container needs to be cycled out.\n/health-check\nService Health Checks\nThese are used to determine if a service is “up” and working for the purposes of uptime calculation and proving that end to end within a service boundary is functioning normally. That is the front end can talk to the api and the api can talk to the DB. Typically a front end service health check will talk to the api version of the same health check.\n/health-check/service\nDependency Health Checks\nThese are used to determine if a service’s external dependencies (external APIs like Notify or the Sirius integrations) are down and may cause service degredation. They should return details of each service status. A more developed version of this will also indicate what impact that service being down will have on the system. Teams shoudl take time to work out the likely impacts, for example Notify being down could just mean email is queued until it is working again.\n/health-check/dependencies\nMonitoring Health Checks\nIt is worth noting that for Route53 health checks AWS considers them unhealthy if they take longer than 4 seconds to connect and longer than 2 seconds to respond with a 200 or 3xx response. This means any health check connecting outside the service boundary (dependency health checks) are not recommended for these. See AWS documentation.\nTeams are encouraged to create other alerts consistent with the nature of their service to alert on broader service healthcheck failures. Some teams may want to use Pingdom, but this is not suitable for internal-only services behind an allowlist.\nConsequences\n\n\nWork will need to happen to normalise the various health checks across the estate.\nTeams will need to indentify what a dependency failure means for a given service and make that explicit with Product colleagues.\nWe will report Service Health Checks in any request for uptime stats.\n\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-007.html"},"26":{"title":"ADR-002 Application Domain Names","content":"ADR-002 Application Domain Names\nDate: 02-06-2021\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nEstablish a pattern for naming domains, currently we have a few variations across products and we should aim to be consistent where possible.\nDecision\nReflect the MoJ security guidance and MoJ naming standards where possible.\nMultiple Hosted Zones\nHaving multiple hosted zones is necessary if you have multiple stacks in an environment due a limitaion with\nAmazon Certificate Manager.

This should be handled automatically in the build pipeline\nfor the service based off commit messages added by the developer. This will allow better observability of breaking changes, more obvious discussions around contract testing,\nand everyone talking in a common language.\nVersions should be pushed to github and used as the identifier for any build artifacts.\nThe accepted standard for semantic versioning is:\nv1.234.567\nWhere:\nv{major version}.{minor version}.{patch version}\nWhat determines the version bump:\nMajor: A large change to the functionality of the application and/or a change to its API that is not backwards compatible with one or more of it’s consumers. e.g. A change in the API contract.\nMinor: Adding a new feature or deprecating an existing feature that does not break any consumer contracts.\nPatch: An upgrade to a dependency, a refactor of code, or a bug fix that doesn’t break any consumer contracts.\nConsequences\nSome products may have to do some slight refactoring work to change how they version and tag their artifacts/repositories.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-003.html"},"28":{"title":"ADR-005 Put prototypes on the MOJ Cloud Platform","content":"ADR-005 Put prototypes on the MOJ Cloud Platform\nDate: 26-11-2021\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nWe have various prototypes of none-live services stored in GitHub that need to be shared with internal and external stakeholders in a usable form.\nPreviously we had prototypes scattered on various un-manmaged Heroku instances, sitting in either personal or organisation accounts of without clear control. This has made tracking ownership and deployment harder as time went on, particularly where projects have paused or had time between prototype work and new people needed access.\nGiven that the MOJ Cloud PLatform can host things easily and provides tooling to enable it easily, it makes sense to use it to host any prototypes produced for OPG Digital.\nDecision\nHost any prototypes for new services on MOJ Cloud PLatform.\nConsequences\nAny existing prototypes should be moved off Heroku and redirects put in place to their new location. The Heroku redirect repo provides code for this. Cost of using this hosting will need to be recharged.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-005.html"},"29":{"title":"ADR-011 Patching Expectations","content":"ADR-011 Patching Expectations\nDate: 21-04-2024\nStatus\n🤔 Proposed\nContext\nHistorically some products were not kept up to date with the dependencies they used. This made it very hard to update to security patched versions of components where drift has got too far behind current maintained versions. To avoid this happening again we moved our repos to use tools like Dependabot and Renovate to ensure we had automation to inform us of new versions of dependencies so we could patch in a timely way.\nWith these tools installed on a code repository teams have a way to automate keeping up to date. However teams can find themselves with many pull requests to manage. This can lead to time spent investigating updates or fixing builds, and some confusion about relative priority of the different patch/minor or major updates for a given project.\nDecision\nAll teams have control of their Renovate configuration and should adjust the defaults to fit their service’s cadence and ecosystem. A team should set how many updates Renovate produces at once according to how many the team can deal with at once.\nAs standard we have a 3 days stability wait on all PRs that update dependencies to reduce the chance of dependency poisoning attacks.\nRenovate groups patch and minor updates by default. Teams should configure Renovate to partition dependencies by type to avoid large PRs you cannot reason about when a build is broken. Common partitions are by dependency type (Docker, PHP, JS, etc) or by dependency usage (dev, prod). Make An LPA has a good example of this kind of split.\nAvoid situations where a single patch and minor updates PR keeps getting more and more updates and becomes unwieldy. Remember you can always manually update a set of dependencies via local tools and renvoate will pick up the changes and reduce a PRs size.\nParticularly chatty dependencies like the AWS SDK, which receive multiple updates a day, should be rate limited to avoid noise.\nTeams should prioritise PR updates as follows:\n\n\nIf it is a security update then follow the MOJ Security Patching Schedule which is 3-7 days for HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities.\nFor any out of support or deprecated package work to update it should be scheduled within 1 month\nIf it is a patch or minor update is made available it should be merged within 3-4 weeks.\nMajor versions should ideally be updated within 4-6 months, should be on actively supported versions and never be more than 2 major versions behind the current release of that dependency\n\nExamples:\nPHP Unit 11 is the current major version. If your product is on PHPUnit 10.5.19, you should merge point and patch versions as they become available, so an update to 10.5.20 should be merged within 3 weeks of being released. When version 12 is released the team should update to version 11 or greater.\nNote on Automerge\nIt is not recommended to use auto-merge since it risks us moving away from the principle of “owning it out to production” for any given merge if nobody is responsbile for the merge. Particularly if auto-merge schedules might kick in on bank holidays or out of hours.\nConsequences\nTeams own their Renovate configuration and can adjust it to local needs and capacity.\nTeams should prioritise security patching over other forms of patching.\nTeams have leeway on major version updates as long as they are within supported versions and last 2 major versions.\nTeams should be able to configure Renovate to avoid overloading them with busy-work from dependency churn.\nSee also our general dependencies guidelines.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-011.html"},"30":{"title":"ADR-009 Log structure","content":"ADR-009 Log structure\nDate: 14-02-2024\nStatus\n🤔 Proposed\nContext\nRegardless of platform or language, our services write logging information to the output stream. However, this logging information is inconsitently structured. This leads to a few problems:\n\n\nIt is hard to interpret logs under standard operation, as logs from different containers with different structures are interspersed\nDuring an incident, it is hard to find related logs as the inconsistent structures require separate queries\nOur log-based alarms are complex to write and update as they have to query several different structures\n\nDecision\nWe will define a standard logging structure that all teams will use. Teams are welcome to expand on the structure by adding extra fields, but must include all required fields in each log message and must ensure not to use reserved fields for anything other than their defined usage.\nAll logs must be formatted as JSON objects.\nAn example of a minimal log message:\n{\"time\": \"2024-02-14T12:34:23Z\", \"level\": \"CRITICAL\", \"msg\": \"Null pointer exception\", \"service_name\": \"opg-example\"}\nAn example of a more complex log message:\n{\n  \"time\": \"2024-02-14T13:39:01Z\",\n  \"level\": \"INFO\",\n  \"msg\": \"User permissions updated\",\n  \"service_name\": \"opg-example\",\n  \"trace_id\": \"1-581cf771-a006649127e371903a2de979\",\n  \"request\": { \"method\": \"PUT\", \"path\": \"/user/133/permissions\" },\n  \"location\": { \"file\": \"pages/user/edit_permission.go\", \"line\": 156 },\n  \"actor_id\": 48\n}\nAs well as the required and reserved fields below, log messages can include any other fields (such as “location” and “actor_id” above).\nRequired fields\ntime must be an RFC3339-formatted date/time.\nlevel must be an RFC5424-defined log level in uppercase: EMERGENCY, ALERT, CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, NOTICE, INFO, DEBUG. Services don’t need to use every log level, but alarms and stored queries should account for them all. Whilst all log levels can be used in code, the minimum logging level should be INFO in non-dev environments.\nmsg is the free form message.\nservice_name is the name of the container or lambda outputting the log.\nReserved fields\nrequest, if provided, must be an object containing a method property of the request’s HTTP method, and a path property of the requested path. Additional properties are permitted.\ntrace_id, if provided, must be a string containing the AWS X-Ray trace ID of the orgininating request.\nConsequences\nReading logs interspersed between different services and containers will be easier as they all follow the same structure. We will be able to write common queries and alarms that work across all of our services.\nEach team will need to review their current logging instrumentation to ensure it matches this structure.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-009.html"},"31":{"title":"ADR-001 Shared Library Organisation","content":"ADR-001 Shared Library Organisation\nDate: 2021-02-09\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nWe produce shared code and need to keep it well organised.\nDecision\nThe organisation of repositories for components, modules and packages produced by OPG digital’s WebOps community should be small and specific over collected and centralised.\nConsequences\nThe OPG digital Webops community could proliferate lots of small repositories that will need to be maintained, but this can be a benefit to each. It enables finer version control, tight scoping, discrete automation and reduces barriers to publication.\nNaming things is hard, and members of the community will need to keep good and relevant naming conventions to help others to find and understand the purpose of the shared code.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-001.html"},"32":{"title":"ADR-008 Deployment environments","content":"ADR-008 Deployment environments\nDate: 27-11-2023\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nWhen working across multiple teams, or switching between teams, it can be hard to follow what each deployment environment is for and what practices it keeps. This can lead to data ending up in an improper environment, or tests being run with incorrect assumptions of the state of the environment.\nWe sometimes need to test, demo or explore functionality between multiple connected services. To do so, we need persistent environments of each service that are connected together. Not all products have this, and those that do can be inconsistent, making it harder to perform these activities.\nDecision\nAll services must have the following essential environments, which should be deployed sequentially as part of the path to live:\n\n\nLocal environment\nDeployment testing environment\nProduction environment\nDemo environment\n\nServices may commonly have additional environments:\n\n\nAutomatic PR environments\nManual PR environments\nPreproduction environment\nOther persistent environments\n\nProduction environment\nThis is what our users access and it contains our real data. It must be the only environment in the production account.\nDeployment testing environment\nEvery service must have at least one environment that is as close to production’s infrastructure and scale as feasible. This may contain a copy of production data and live in the preproduction account, or may contain synthetic data and live in the development account.\nIt is not accessible by the public. It is deployed in the pipeline before production to test that the release can be deployed successfully.\nDemo environment\nThis is used to test, demo and explore functionality against the currently deployed release. It is in the development account, does not contain production data and is not accessible by the public. It is deployed in the pipeline after production to ensure it reflects the latest releaase.\nIt is connected to the demo environment of any dependencies, and is the target of the demo environemnt of any dependent services. This allows cross-service testing.\nIt is be available at demo.development.{production host}.\nLocal environment\nAll services must be available to stand-up on departmental laptops in some form for local development and testing. Local environments should not require any external connections to dependent services (though their build pipeline may require external connection to e.g. fetch code and packages).\nAutomatic PR environments\nThese are created automatically when a pull request is raised to use for testing and demo of changes before they are merged. They are in the development account and are not accessible by the public.\nThese environments should be used to test against, rather than using local containerised environments on the CI runner, to provide a higher level of confidence.\nWhen the pull request is merged, the associated environment is automatically destroyed.\nThey are available at {automatically derived name}.development.{production host}\nManual PR environments\nIn some services it may be impractical to automatically create environments for every pull request. In this case, it should be possible to manually create an environment based on the pull request. These environments should have a “deletion date” on creation and automatically be destroyed when that date is passed.\nThey are available at {manually or automatically derived name}.development.{production host}\nIn all other regards, they are the same as automatic PR environments.\nPreproduction environment\nThis has identical infrastructure and data to the production environment though is not connected to external services. It is in the preproduction account and is not accesible to the public.\nIt is used to test against a real data set, where synthetic data is not reflective or large enough to provide confidence. It may the deployment testing environment and deployed to as part of the main pipeline, or be deployed to manually whe needed.\nIt is be available at preproduction.{production host}.\nOther persistent environments\nSome services may require other persistent environments. For example, for training or user research. These environments may be created automatically or manually, depending on the team’s needs.\nThese environments are in the development account and do not contain production data.\nConsequences\nHaving more consistent environment practices will make developing and maintaining services across multiple teams more predictable and less prone to confusion. Having consistent demo environments will make cross-service testing easier and safer.\nThis will be more challenging for services that make exceptions to this decision, as they might lead to incorrect assumptions. Service teams will need to clearly document their exceptions and explanations to avoid confusion.\nWhere services connect to each other, teams must document which environments are connected and what type of data (production, pseudonymised etc.) each uses. This is essential to ensure that private data does not incorrectly cross tiers.\n","url":"/documentation/adrs/adr-008.html"},"33":{"title":"ADR-006 Migrate to Github Actions instead of CircleCI","content":"ADR-006 Migrate to Github Actions instead of CircleCI\nDate: 14-02-2023\nStatus\n✅ Accepted\nContext\nCircleCI has been in use at OPG since 2018 and was our primary CI/CD tool for much of that time. It has been handling builds and deployments for all of our major services and code bases - including core items like opg-org-infra. However, after trailing GitHub Actions, which has organically grown to become our most widely used CI/CD tool, it is a suitable time to reassess our support and usage of CircleCI.\nAs GitHub Actions is an additional feature of GitHub - our primary code repository host - it is exceptionally well integrated with our code bases and offers a range of features that CircleCI does not support:\n\n\nDifferential between a variable whose content should be seen as privileged or not (via secrets) and when using a secret the information is masked / redacted\nMore granular access control for secrets / environment variables.

also: Incident process\nIncidents sound scary, the term “incident” just means something is going wrong or\nnot working as expected. Incidents can happen anywhere, and we face technology outages\nthat will impact our users.\nWe can’t stop incidents from happening, but we can make sure we are ready to deal\nwith them.\nWhat is incident response?\nThis is the broad term that refers to the processes we follow when something happens.\nThese are the things we should be thinking about apart from actually fixing the issue:\n\n\nCommunicating with ourselves\nCommunication with users\nClearly defining roles\nGetting the right people involved\nTracking what’s happened\n\nIncident Priority\nAssign a priority level to incidents based on their complexity, urgency and resolution time. Incident severity also determines response times and support level.\nIncident priority table\n\n        \n          \nClassification\nType\nExample\nResponse time\nUpdate frequency\n\nP1\nCritical\nComplete outage, or ongoing unauthorised access\n20 minutes\n30 Minutes\n\nP2\nMajor\nSubstantial degradation of service\n60 minutes\n1 hours\n\nP3\nSignificant\nUsers experiencing intermittent or degraded service due to platform issue\n2 hours\nOnce after 2 business days\n\nP4\nMinor\nComponent failure that does not immediately impact a service, or an unsuccessful DoS attempt\n1 business day\nOnce after 5 business days\n\n        \n      Guidance for products\nThe main incident response process is stored here in the opg-technical-guidance\nrespository.

At this stage, you only need to select whether its a live incident or something that’s already happened that you’d like to report. All the other information can be filled in later.\nThe Slack bot will automatically post a message into the #opg-incident channel and create an entry on the incident response site. This marks the offical start of an incident\nImmediate first steps\nAs soon as the tool has posted a message into #opg-incident you should do these steps immediatly\n\n\nUse the create communtications channel button in the message (only available for active incidents)\nPage the on-call incident lead\nIf appropriate, start a conference call for further discussion\n\nEnsure roles have been assigned\nThere are two roles that must be filled for every incident. They are the Incident Lead and Incident Scribe\n\n\nIn rare cases, the same person might fill both roles but this is discouraged.\n\nIncident Reporter\nThis is whoever discovered the issue and declared the incident.\nIncident Lead\nThe incident reporter should call in a designated incident lead, typically a Technical Architect, Lead or Senior WebOps or Lead Dev.\nThe incident lead is the lead coordination role and should be someone who has experience running incidents in OPG. It is preferable if they are not in a team affected by the incident so that they can provide an unbiased view.\nResponsibilities\n\n\nCoordinate our response to the incident\nDecide on any additional roles required (e.g. a communications lead may be required)\nEnsure that all required roles are filled\nEnsure that all tasks which need to be handled are being done\nMake the final decision whenever we need to choose a course of action\nSet the schedule for any regular team check-ins, if those are deemed necessary\nDeclare the incident closed, when appropriate\nEnsure that the post-incident process is followed\n\n\n\nNB: The incident lead needs to ensure that things are being done, they do not need to do them\n\nOnce appointed, the incident lead should update the following information using the Slack bot in the dedicated communications channel.\n\n\nincident summary @opg-incident-response summary \u003cdescribe the incident\u003e\nincident severity @opg-incident-response sev \u003cCritical, Major, Trivial\u003e\nincident impact @opg-incident-response impact \u003cdescribe the impact\u003e\n\nIncident Scribe\nThe incident scribe can be someone in a team affected by the incident. Ask for volunteers verbally or via Slack.\nResponsibilities\nThe scribe is responsible for keeping a log of the incident, including:\n\n\nImportant events\nDiscussion topics\nDecisions\nActions\nResults of actions/investigations\n\n\n\nNB: this log is not intended to be a verbatim transcript of discussions. Rather, things like “xxx suggested the disk might be full.\nyyy to investigate and report back”\n\nOnce appointed, the scribe should update the incident header at the top of the channel with a link to the living document on the incident response site.\nThe scribe can pin important message in the incident channel and the Slack tool will automatically add those into the timeline summary. They can also add\nactions to the incident log using the command @opg-incident-response action \u003caction_description\u003e\nWhen conversation happens verbally, it is the scribe’s responsibility to ensure anything that needs to be logged is written up in the incident channel.\nCommunications Lead\nDepending on the impact/duration of an incident, it may be desirable to appoint a communications lead.\nIt is usually best if this is a member of the product profession to facilitate clear communications with the business.\nResponsibilities\n\n\nCommunicate the incident out to those who are impacted\nDecide what, how and how often to issue updates\nGive updates at regular intervals\nField enquiries so the team can focus on fixing the incident without interruptions\nDisseminate a post-incident report\n\nYou can update the Statuspage via the following command in the dedicated incident channel\n\n\n@opg-incident-response statuspage\n\nTransferring roles\nIt may be necessary to transfer roles from one team member to another, e.g. during long-running incidents. In this case, it is the responsibility\nof whoever is in a role to ensure that someone else takes it over.\nWhoever assumes a role should announce it in the incident channel, so that the team is aware and updated\nFixing the problem\nPlease bear in mind that not every incident requires the whole team to be involved.\nThings you may want to consider:\n\n\nStart a conference call to hold ongoing discussions\nSwarm on the problem\nStep back if you are not contributing and you don’t have one of the key roles\nBring in members of other teams with relevant knowledge\nAsk in #opg-all-team-digital, #opg-webops-community or #opg-developers for relevant experience from outside your team\n\nEnd the incident\nWhen work on the problem has ceased, either because the problem has been resolved or because resolution is blocked until a later date,\nthe incident lead should update the Slack tool to close the incident.\n@opg-incident-response close\nThis marks the official end of the incident. If users were notified of the incident, the communications lead should send an appropriate message via the same channels to tell them it’s over.\nPost Incident\nAfter the incident is resolved:\n\n\nSchedule a root cause analysis (RCA) session to identify where we can improve\nDocument the outcome of the RCA in the OPG Security confluence space\nShare the RCA outcomes with the delivery team and wider OPG Digital so they can learn from it too\n\nRecords and retention\nThe dedicated incident channel should be archived once the issue is fixed.\nThe incident response site will keep an archive of the messages pinned by the incident scribe.\nWhere appropriate, the root cause analysis may shared with the Amazon Technical Account Managers.\n","url":"/documentation/incidents/process.html"},"146":{"title":"Create \u0026 Deploy Prototype Sites","content":"Create \u0026 Deploy Prototype Sites\nPre-requisites\nTo complete the steps in this guide, you will need:\n\n\nTo be a member of the OPG GitHub team in the MoJ GitHub Organisation\nThe Cloud Platform CLI installed\nA local development environment including a terminal and a git client\n\n1.

We’ve since started rolling it out in other services (Supervision Workflow, Search Service). Now we have a bit more experience working with the language. It’s worth documenting our preferred approaches, tools and libraries for doing so. This will help future developers get up to speed on our services more easily and set some expectations for team members to reference when starting new work.\nWhy Golang?\nWe chose to adopt golang as a secondary language within OPG Digital because:\n\n\nModern language\nSmall ecosystem\nWeb features as first class citizens\nPerformant and produces small containers\nAligned to infrastructure tooling languages\n\nPrefered Tools \u0026 Libraries\n\n\ngolangci-lint - Fast golang linter for checking code style in CI or locally. This bundles lots of the other linters in the golang ecosystem including gosec to check for potential security issues. Install it to your local machine with brew install golangci-lint\ntestify - Testing tools, including more readable assertions and mocking tools.\nopg-go-healthcheck - Adds a healthcheck to your go service for use with ECS and other container orchestration systems.\naws-sdk-go-v2 - AWS SDK for golang. Because we use lots of AWS. Make sure you move to v2.\nair - Allows hot reloading during development so you don’t need to manually recompile on changes.\nzap - A nice structured logging library for JSON output\n\nTools useful in services\n\n\naws-secretsmanager-caching-go - Caching secrets in memory and calling for new ones if they fail rather than using environment vars.\njwt-go - JWT implementation for go, useful for talking to Sirius APIs.\nobjx - Useful tools for dealing with JSON and maps.\ngo-spew - A nicer pretty printer for development/debugging.\n\nNote we previously recommended gorilla/mux, but that set of libraries had maintenence issues and since that time the core HTTP router has evolved to cover most uses cases. Use the internal HTTP router unless you have a very odd edge case, see the golang 1.22 release notes.\nPreferred Patterns\nUber-go - Go has a very good built-in formatter for writing correct Go. This Uber style README.md covers extra stylistic concerns not covered by Go’s standard practices. For example the Verifying Interface Compliance\nGenerally our golang services are microservices and micro-frontends. This allows us to build small, isolated components focused on a particular domain that can be deployed independently. One repo per service.\nOur normal coding standards and repo principles still apply.\ngo:embed annotations are useful for bundling templates\nOur micro-frontends use cypress for end-to-end testing.\nWe recommend you add in pre-commit hooks to your repo.\nLearning Resources\n\n\nhttps://tour.golang.org/ - The official Golang tour for learning Go.

We use many open source libraries written by 3rd parties to provide functionality in our apps. In PHP we use composer to install these external libraries and we have similar tools for node, python and golang.\nThe last few years have seen an uptick in security attacks using trusted dependencies and weak security in the management of package ecosystems to compromise applications. Node, PHP and Python have all had high profile compromises, we’ve been very fortuante to not be using the packages affected.\nSecurity is not the only issue though, some languages lean more into the working practice of grabbing any dependency rather than fully assessing if you need it. This can lead to long term maintenence churn on packages providing very simple functionality or bringing in a massive node package download to the frontend to achieve something simple provided by in-browser functionality. Both of which can create work we don’t need.\nThis guidance is to formalise the rules of thumb used to choose externally provided libraries to ensure we reduce the risk of a compromised package and minimise our maintenence burden.\nNew Libraries and Dependencies Guidance\n1. Question if you need an external dependency\nWe need to balance not-reinventing the wheel with taking on a support and security burden. “Would it take longer than a day to write the thing yourself?” is a good question to ask. It’s worth taking the time to research how difficult that would be. You have the chance to do some learning and development in an area, which you can share and builds the whole team’s experience. Maybe that’s better than outsourcing the knowledge and approach to a 3rd party?\nEqually, it could be an area that’s complex and requires detailed specialist knowledge to work in, such as security, interoperability with closed source code or detailed understanding of standards. In these cases letting somebody else do the work is advisable as time, effort and specialist knowledge take time to acquire.\nAnother question to ask before writing your own code is “will it take longer than a day to maintain?” Just because you understand it now doesn’t mean you’ll understand it in a year. If you write it yourself who handles ongoing support and who else understands it? Consider if it’s not application code, but really a shared library within OPG for a specific need we all share so we don’t end up copy-pasting code about.\nThe tradeoff here is essentially how much time does a 3rd party dependency save you now, versus how much time will it cost you later.\nThis article written following the incident with the colors.js library is a good explanation on reuse vs build.\n2. Always check the GitHub repo for recent activity\nYou want a library that is getting regular patches and security updates.\nYou also want a library that doesn’t change its external API every 6 months, forcing you to rework large portions of your app to accomodate it. Reading around about the library can assist you in getting a feel for this as can looking at which major version it is, be suspicious of anything lower than 1.0.0 or with flags for “not yet production ready” or “proof of concept”\nYou want a library that is compatible with the main framework you are using and any coding standards your team have in place. You also need to consider if it’s maintaining compatibility with upcoming language and framework versions. We’ve seen this with Laminas and PHP 8.1 compatibilities, for example, where there was a lag in language compatibility updates.\n3. Check that the dependency is managed by a community\nSingle contributor libraries have more chance of being compromised and nobody noticing. More eyes on changes means more chance of vandalism or malicious activity being caught earlier.\nCommunities also enforce standards and tend to mean APIs are more stable as others need to use them too. Communities supported by charitable trust (JS foundation) or big organisations (Mozilla) tend to help with ensuring maintenence, stability and backward compatibility.\nLibraries with single maintainers, even well known ones, can be subject to issues not found in larger communities, like the creator rage quitting (see node left pad) or just vanishing and the package becoming abandoned.\nThe number of open issues and how they are responded to can also be an indicator of community health. It’s worth being wary of anything with a high number of “won’t fix” type labels.\n4. Check the license on the dependency\nNot all software licenses are compatible. We use an MIT license for our open source code, so anything using that is 100% compatible.\nSome licenses may be incompatible with private storage of source code, for example due to forcing publication, which might not be appropriate to a service that requires some parts of its codebase to be private for operational reasons.\n5. Check how the library responded to any previous security incidents\nTransparency and quick reaction to any previous security issues are a good sign of how a library’s maintainers will react next time. Particularly if they have defined incident processes, public lessons learned and risk mitigations already in place.\n6. See how easy contributing is\nWe like to give back if we use things, hopefully that’s not a painful process. How easy is it for a new contributor to get a PR merged on the library? This will help if we do need to patch something upstream to gain compatibility with recent language versions.\nThis can be a downside too: what checks do you need to pass to get code added? Is it too easy? Could somebody manipulate that process?\n7. Do you need the whole thing?\nSmaller libraries are prefered to larger frameworks to avoid bringing in large amounts of code you don’t need for one class or method you do. The attack surface of a bigger project means there’s more potential for you to get an exploit in unrelated code you end up shipping anyway.\nThis is particularly an issue with frontend dependencies, don’t add 1 library with 40 sub dependencies just to do something browsers can do anyway with CSS or native APIs. The performance and usability impact of 25mb of JS just to add a hover effect should not be underestimated. Check out tools like tree-shaking in builds that can reduce this by not deploying unused codepaths.\n8. Check what the library’s own dependencies look like\nSometimes it’s not the direct dependency itself that’s the risk, but the dependencies of the dependency. It’s worth checking for further downstream projects with the same set of issues.\n9. Pin to a specific version\nIt’s always best to pin a given dependency to a specific version. So using 1.0.4 rather than a less specific ^1.0.\nWhile lock files will pin to known good versions, you might inadvertantly pull in a malicious version 1.0.5 as it becomes available as part of development changes when updating packages if you aren’t pinned.\nWe have dependabot to pull in point-version updates when they become available. For particularly volatile ecosystems (NPM/Node) it is best to wait a 3 days before merging PRs for non-security related updates to allow time for malicious activity to be detected.\nSome teams have experimented with automerging patch updates. If you do this it’s worth automating the 3 day wait, particularly if your app is node based. Critical security updates are worth considering in isolation, as it may be that you are at greater risk leaving it unpatched for 3 days than the patch itself being bad. A check of the upstream commits for tampering can help make decisions on this.\n10. Look for opportunities to refactor out dependencies\nNot all our code bases are new (Sirius and Make at now 8 years old in places). As such it’s always worth being on the lookout for dependencies that were good at time of implementation, but have since fallen behind or lost support. It’s always good to reassess the value of a given dependency, in some cases the core language or framework will have moved on and now provide functionality natively. A good example of this is jQuery, where a decade ago you needed its selector engine, but now the web platform provides document.querySelectorAll()`. In general do this at least every 6 months.\nPay particular attention for the warnings of “no longer supported” that package managers will provide.\n","url":"/documentation/guides/dependencies.html"},"152":{"title":"Baseline Testing Standards","content":"Baseline Testing Standards\nThe intent here is to document a baseline test strategy that we expect applications to adhere to in order to ensure a minimal level of quality assurance. This is not exhaustive and it is expected to change over time as we learn and grow. Different applications and teams will also have different needs so there should be room for local variance. However that should be a conscious choice and be able to be explained and preferably documented e.g. in an ADR.\nStrategy\nPlease refer to testing language section for a fuller explanation of terms.\nAll applications should have the following automation:\n\n\nSmoke tests\nIntegration tests\nUnit tests\nRegression should be built into automation at the unit and integration level\n\nWhile developing tickets teams are expected to:\n\n\nEnsure there is adequate automation at all levels and we meet any criteria agreed in the team around our measurements\nIncorporate testing into their ticket process e.g. with test charters, three amigos type sessions, etc.\nEnsure every ticket receives some exploratory testing from the developers working on it before it goes to review. Some coaching of good test planning may be required e.g. also having a charter of steps completed available in the PR to review, do what makes sense locally however.\n\nTest Suite - Definition of Good\nWhen running through an exercise to review what a test suite should achieve as a product we were able to identify that a test suite should provide the following the following:\nConfidence\n\n\nCovers acceptance criteria and business need, each test provides value\nTests are maintained and are not in a broken state\nResults are deterministic - the same input will create the result (not flaky)\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nProvides living documentation that keeps pace with application development\nHas good naming to make it easy to read and follow\n\nFeedback\n\n\nClear identification of what has broken and the business impact e.g. through good naming, structure of tests and structure of suite\nGood detail of how something has broken and the steps to reproduce e.g. relevant tracing, logging, etc.\nTests are easy to setup and run\nTests fail/success fast both individually and as a whole suite\n\nMeasurements\nBelow are some measurements all teams should keep an eye on related to their test suites and their quality assurance processes. These have been derived as things that can measure our progress towards the goals of a good test suite.\nThe expectation is for teams to measure these things and then to start deriving sensible goals about how to react to the measures e.g. what is acceptable locally.\nAll suites must measure:\n\n\nTest coverage (Confidence + Documentation)\n\n\nAs a whole\nAs a delta introduced by each pull request\n\nTime test suites take to execute (Feedback)\n\n\nAs a whole suite\nAs a delta introduced by each pull request\n\nReliability. For example tracking how often particular tests fail to highlight flaky tests (Confidence + Feedback)\n\nAll teams should measure:\n\n\nThe time it takes for a ticket to move across the board from finished development to release (Is our strategy improving the team workflow)\n\nIn a low coverage scenario:\n\n\nDefect density and other measures to approach introducing coverage on a risk basis\n\nTesting Language\nIn order to make conversations clearer and aid our shared understanding we have undertaken an exercise in agreeing common testing terms and their meaning in the OPG context. In order to stay close to industry standards we have started with ISTQB as a reference and expanded when extra context is needed.\nSmoke\nSmoke testing is executed upon deployment of an application and it comprises the testing of two concerns:\n\n\nThe core customer value works as expected. This is tackled with Journey tests.\nThe application is configured correctly. This is tackled with Dependency tests.\n\nJourney\nPrimarily in the context of smoke testing. This is a light touch covering the core functionality of the application to ensure core customer journeys are operating as intended on deployment. This is achieved through exercising these core customer journeys typically through GUI tests but may comprise other elements e.g. API tests.\nDependency\nOnly in the context of smoke testing. These tests ensure all application dependencies e.g. databases, third party APIs, Amazon services, etc. are configured in the target deployment environment correctly. This may be tackled with a variety of methods as long as all dependencies are exercised at least once e.g. some or all may be covered by Journey tests.\nIntegration\nFocusing on a single application, typically an API. These tests exercise the running application as a whole, splitting functionality into vertical slices, ensuring the application behaves in accordance to acceptance criteria. The intent here is to test individual units or components coming together as a whole to deliver value. This includes how the application may call third parties.\nAPI\nTypically testing a HTTP API. These are a form of Integration test. Here the application under test is exercised through the use of HTTP calls and validated through a mixture of checking responses and inspecting other side effects e.g. database updates, items being posted to a queue, emails being sent, etc.\nEnd to End\n\n\nInteracting with UI\nTest user journeys through the application(s). Focus on the journey rather than thinking about app dependencies.\n\nGUI\nTypically testing  a web application. These tests exercise a frontend web application by interacting with the web page from the equivalent of a user perspective and validate based on what is visible. These are of the same style as Journey tests however they are not strung together to map to a whole customer journey.\nComponent\nTypically used to test an Angular application. These tests are the equivalent of frontend Unit tests that exercise angular components and validate based on interactions with services through the use of mocked services.\nUnit\nTest a small piece of functionality or pure logic in isolation. We are a Mockist house that mocks out the behaviour of any dependencies.\nExploratory\n“An approach to testing whereby the testers dynamically design and execute tests based on their knowledge, exploration of the test item and the results of previous tests.“ - ISTQB\nIn OPG we define a start point and leave the charter deliberately loose.

See Explore It! and other resources.\nRegression\nCurrently, where there is inadequate test coverage manual regression testing occurs to ensure previously working functionality remains in a good state. The desire here is to automate a lot of this work where it isn’t already automated.\nUser acceptance\nTesting undertaken manually with actual users. This is conducted by OPG business and not the digital team. Not to be confused with user research.\nRelease candidate\nThis is more the embodiment of a current process step and will change as our processes do.

However, as these are designed to support all Government departments, they sometimes do not go into enough detail.\nThe OPG API Standards provide additional guidance for designing and building APIs. They intend to make the API build process easier by answering common questions about what best practices are.\nYou should adopt these standards if there is no reason not to, but you may break any of them if you have a contradicting need.\nDesign\n\n\nUse JSON for request and response bodies\nUse lowerCamelCase for keys\nPrefer flat structure, we don’t have a standard response format and should keep things as minimal as possible (e.g. don’t use JSON:API, or have all responses like {\"data\": ...})\nUse RFC3339 to format dates\nExamples of RFC3339 formatted dates:\n\n\n2023-06-16\n2023-06-16T09:04:38Z\n09:04:46Z\n\n\nResource naming\nAs the CDDO API standards outline, we use a REST API architectural style. Additionally:\n\n\nResources are represented by nouns. Resource names can be “real” nouns or abstract collections e.g. /users or /user-management\nA resource can be a singleton or a collection. Collections are pluralised and singletons are addressed by ID\n\n\n/users is a collection\n/users/1 is the singleton in that collection\n\nResources are hierarchical, and resources may contain other resources. These relationships are denoted with forward slashes. e.g. /teams/1/users\nA URI addresses the resource, not the action. HTTP methods should be used to indicate the action being performed. e.g. HTTP POST /users, not /users/create\nUse query parameters to filter a resource collection instead of creating a new URI. e.g. /users?role=admin\nUse hyphens to improve readability. Avoid underscores and other separators. e.g. /device-management/os-versions\nUse lower case only. Case sensitivity is dependent on the browser, server, and host OS, so mixed-case should be avoided.\nDo not use file extensions in URIs. If this information needs to be communicated, use the Content-Type header.\n\nSometimes it is impractical to follow a REST style absolutely, e.g. executing actions via an API call. In these instances, you must provide adequate documentation so consumers are aware it is not addressing a resource.\nVersioning\n\n\nAvoid versioning until there is a definite requirement\nUse semantic versioning to provide meaning and context to version changes\nEncode version in the header via Content Negotiation (Accept header) e.g. Accept: application/vnd.opg-data.v1+json\nPrefer additive changes over destructive ones\nProvide clear documentation\nProvide concrete deadlines to consumers when removing part of an API\nEnsure network traffic is well-monitored to detect abuse\n\nFor further information, see the OPG Data versioning strategy\nDocumentation\n\n\nUse the OpenAPI Specification for documenting APIs\n\n\nThis may be used by your API’s consumers to automatically generate mocks using tools like Prism or Imposter\n\nStore your OpenAPI Specification file in the repo at /docs/openapi/openapi.yml\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nUse JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate requests between OPG services\n\n\nEach JWT must contain the following claims:\n\n\nsub: Either an identifier of the user making the request (e.g. email address) or a service identifier if not user is involved\niat: The timestamp of when the token was issued\nexp: The timestamp of when the token will expire\niss: The service that issued the token\n\nAPIs must validate “exp”, “iat” and “iss” claims, and the “nbf” claim if provided\n\nWhere APIs only have consumers inside OPG, use infrastructure tools (e.g. AWS IAM) to restrict access to those services\n\nPerformance\n\n\nWe have no explicit departmental performance requirements, but you should discuss as a team if you can set any for yourselves.\nMonitor realtime performance of your production services with the tools provided by AWS, such as CloudWatch Metrics and X-Ray\nConsider alternative techniques for slow-running transactions such as using asynchronous request/response patterns, or queuing onerous processes to execute after the response has been sent\n\nUseful links\n\n\nAPI Working Group\n\n","url":"/documentation/guides/api_standards.html"},"154":{"title":"Github Actions Security","content":"Github Actions Security\nOur aim is to make our products as secure as possible while maintaining usability for end users. This is in line with the GDS service standard. You should be aware of the MOJ Security Guidance, which will help with specific policy issues at an MOJ level and follow the National Cyber Security Centre for updates at a government level.\nGuiding Principals\nTo give us guidance in the reasons behind our pipeline security practices, we have a number of directives or guiding principles.\nThe mitigations that we put in place are aimed at aligning with one or more guiding principles.\n\n\nProtect Customer Data - Stop customer data from being viewed by anyone who is not allowed to see it under GDPR and make sure that it isn’t changed by any person or process that is not part of expected business functionality.\nProtect Service Uptime and Performance - Avoid negative impact on the amount of time that a service is up, functional and performant unless that impact is part of a reasoned business decision.\nProtect MoJ Infrastructure - Ensure that no infratsructure resources are created, modified or deleted unintentionally, maliciously or without the correct checks and approvals.\nProtect Staff Members and their Privacy - Ensure that staff members personal details are not put at risk or that malicious actions are not carried out in their name.\nProtect Organisational Reputation - Stop activity that would put at risk the reputation of the MoJ (specifically by not protecting against some combination of the aforementioned points).\n\nSpecific Risks\nGithub App Compromise\nDescription\nSome Github apps have the ability to open PRs on our repos. If the app was compromised in some way then when the webhook processed the request on our repo,\nit could open a pull request with anything in it unless the correct protections were put in place.\nAs this opens the PR on our repo rather than a forked branch, then if the correct precautions aren’t put in place then it could gain access to secrets or create infrastructure.\nRisks\nAccess to secrets used in the pipeline or ability to do whatever a user could do in a pull request pipeline.\nMitigations\n\n\nOIDC Per Environment: Use branch-limited OIDC roles to restrict access to sensitive environments. Non-main branches or pull request branches should not access non-development AWS accounts.\nbranch protection - main branch should be protected against unapproved merge\nrestricted management CI - development infra often requires access to management account for DNS. Lock down the management ci role to resources you need only\ncodeowners approval - to stop changes getting approved by someone outside the team, use codeowners file and set codeowner approval on repo. Add additional restrictions for github action files and codeowners file.\nbranch creation only - limit apps to branch creation only and have a separate job that triggers and creates the pull request. The job that creates the PR can do some checks to make sure only certain files are modified before raising it. We haven’t currently got a system to do this so we would have to look into whether this is an effective solution.\n\n\n\nPackage Compromised (Malicious Code Run at Runtime)\nDescription\nA poisoned package could be introduced either by a Github App (e.g., Renovate or Dependabot) suggesting compromised package versions, or by using a package manager that inadvertently fetches a malicious package.\nAdditionally, a package could be independently poisoned without involvement from any package manager.\nDuring runtime, such a package could exfiltrate sensitive information, including secrets stored in environment variables or by accessing other secrets using credentials available in the Github Actions context.\nThis could happen in a couple of places. During the running of any tests or once the code is deployed in a running app in the cloud.\nRisks\nExfiltration of sensitive secrets stored in environment variables or a secrets manager.\nIf running directly on the base Github Actions machine instead of a container, the package could access Github Actions environment variables, leading to broader exposure of secrets.\nRunning untrusted or malicious code without isolation (e.g., directly executing unit tests on the machine) increases the risk of exposing CI secrets.\nIf it runs once deployed then it could have access to data sources (DBs, Redis etc) as well as secrets that the container it’s on has permissions to access and any env vars in the container.\nMitigations\n\n\nStability Days: Introduce a delay (e.g., a few days) before updating to allow time for malicious packages to be identified and flagged.\nNo Untrusted Packages: Avoid using untrusted or unnecessary packages. Prefer easily maintainable internal solutions for simple functionalities.\nContainer Scanning: Scan containers for vulnerabilities to identify any poisoned or malicious packages (trivy/ecr scanning).\nContainer Hardening: Remove unneeded users, executables, and permissions within containers to minimize attack surfaces.\nRun Code in Containers: Always isolate code execution within containers rather than on the base Github Actions machine to restrict access to environment variables and secrets.\nContainer Linting: Lint and validate container configurations to ensure security best practices are followed.\nUse Trusted Sources: Restrict dependencies to trusted sources and audit critical packages before deployment. For essential functionalities, consider creating and maintaining an internal version of critical packages to reduce dependency risks.\nData Exfiltration Monitoring: Use tools that monitor unusual activity (cloudtrail) and set up alerts for anomalies.\nInfrastructure Scanning: Regularly scan deployed infrastructure for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could allow data exfiltration (security hub, tfsec, trivy, cloudtrail alarms etc).\n\nNote - Haven’t added the protections to GA creds in the example below in this issue as if we run the code in a container then it shouldn’t have access to the GA actions secrets.\n\n\nPackage Compromised (Malicious Code Run During Installation)\nDescription\nA poisoned package may be introduced through a Github App (e.g., Renovate or Dependabot) suggesting malicious package versions, or by using a compromised package manager.\nAdditionally, a package could be poisoned independently of the package manager.\nThis is similar to the above except the malicious code would be run as part of the installation instead of at runtime. In one sense this makes it harder to notice without vulnerability being raised as the malicious code would be hidden in install files that don’t end up in the vendor folders.\nDuring installation, such a package can exfiltrate sensitive information, including environment variables or other secrets accessed using credentials available in the Github Actions context.\nRisks\nHigher risk of it getting pipeline creds as the runtime version of this requires that we run the code in the pipeline for that to happen whereas this is simply if we install the code.\nIf unfiltered CI AWS credentials or Github tokens are exposed, malicious code could destroy resources, create unauthorized infrastructure (e.g., fraud or cryptocurrency mining), or exfiltrate sensitive data.\nSecrets in the CI environment, such as access credentials or API tokens, may be stolen during package installation.\nMitigations\n\n\nOIDC Per Environment: Use branch-limited OIDC roles to restrict access to sensitive environments. Non-main branches or pull request branches should not access non-development AWS accounts.\nAWS Management Restricted: Limit management account access to only essential resources, such as DNS or product-specific infrastructure, and differentiate dev and non-dev permissions.\nInstall in containers: Don’t install packages directly in Github and mount them as this would give package access ot the environment variables. If installed in a docker container then it should only have access to docker env vars.\nCredentials Order: Delay fetching AWS credentials or other secrets until after all dependencies have been installed and validated to minimize exposure during installation.\nStrict Inheritance: Avoid blanket inheritance of secrets in sub-workflows; pass only the required secrets to limit their exposure.\nNo Untrusted Packages: Avoid using untrusted packages where possible. For simple functionalities, use internal solutions to reduce dependency on external sources.\nMinimal AWS Credentials: Assign specific roles for each task (e.g., ECR push, scanning, fetching secrets) and avoid using overly broad permissions.\nStability Days: Implement a waiting period before updating packages to allow malicious packages to be identified and flagged.\nContainer Scanning: Scan containers for vulnerabilities to identify any poisoned or malicious packages (trivy/ecr scanning).\nCodeowners Approval: Use a codeowners file to enforce reviews by appropriate team members, and require additional protections for changes to sensitive files such as Github Actions workflows.\nArtifact Security: Generate and validate artifact hashes to ensure that installed or released packages match the intended versions.\n\n\n\nCompromised Github Action\nDescription\nA poisoned GitHub Action version or pipeline script pulled from an untrusted internet source could introduce malicious code into the CI/CD pipeline. When executed, this code could access and exploit any secrets or credentials available in the GitHub Actions context.\nSuch an attack could lead to exfiltration of sensitive data, destruction of critical infrastructure, or the creation of fraudulent resources like cryptocurrency mining setups.\nRisks\nExfiltration of AWS credentials, GitHub tokens, or other sensitive environment variables.\nMalicious activity such as fraudulent resource creation, data destruction, or unauthorized data access.\nComplete compromise of CI/CD pipeline security.\nMitigations\n\n\nOIDC Per Environment: Use OIDC roles restricted by branch to ensure that pipelines from non-main branches can only access development or test environments, limiting the impact of a compromise.\nAWS Management Restricted: Restrict management account permissions to only the required resources, minimizing the damage potential in case of compromise.\nRestrict Actions to Specified: In repo settings, only allow specified github actions. This prevents nested actions being changed to allow new insecure actions without our knowledge.\nUse Trusted Actions Only: Restrict workflows to use only approved actions maintained by the organization or trusted third parties to avoid introducing malicious actions.\nCreds Order: Only fetch and expose credentials after untrusted code has run, ensuring malicious scripts cannot access secrets. Unset credentials immediately after they are no longer needed.\nStrict Inherit: Avoid blanket inheritance of secrets for sub-workflows. Explicitly define only the necessary permissions and secrets for each sub-workflow.\nNo Untrusted: Avoid using untrusted GitHub Actions or scripts from unknown sources. For simple, repeatable tasks, consider maintaining internal, vetted actions within an organizational repository.\nMinimal AWS Credentials: Assign narrowly scoped AWS roles for specific tasks (e.g., pushing images to ECR or fetching secrets), ensuring malicious code cannot abuse broad permissions.\nStability Days: Enforce a delay period for new or updated GitHub Actions to identify potential security issues before they are executed in sensitive environments.\nCodeowners Approval: Use a Codeowners file to ensure that only authorized personnel can approve changes to critical files such as workflow configurations.\nArtifact Security: Validate artifacts created by CI/CD workflows using signed hashes to ensure their integrity before deployment.\n\n\n\nCompromised Developer Credentials\nDescription\nA malicious developer or someone with developer credentials could modify CI/CD workflows to introduce malicious actions. These actions could exploit AWS credentials or GitHub tokens available in the pipeline to perform harmful operations, such as destroying infrastructure, creating fraudulent resources, or exfiltrating sensitive data.\nRisks\nDestruction of infrastructure and critical resources.\nUnauthorized creation of resources for malicious purposes, such as cryptocurrency mining.\nExfiltration of sensitive data, leading to reputational damage and regulatory penalties.\nMitigations\n\n\nOIDC Per Environment: Use short-lived, branch-restricted OIDC credentials to limit the scope of AWS resources accessible by CI pipelines. This ensures that non-main branches cannot access production accounts.\nAWS Management Restricted: Scope AWS management account permissions to only allow access to essential resources, such as DNS or deployment tools, reducing potential damage.\nCodeowners Approval: Require Codeowners approval for any changes to sensitive files, including GitHub Actions workflows, to prevent unauthorized modifications.\nRestrict CI Access to Customer Data: Ensure that CI roles are denied access to customer data in services like S3, DynamoDB, or RDS, minimizing the potential for data breaches.\nMinimal AWS Credentials: Use narrowly scoped roles for specific tasks in the CI pipeline, such as ECR pushes or fetching secrets, reducing the permissions available to malicious modifications.\nTurn Off Running Forked PRs: Require manual approval for external PRs to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources through malicious workflows.\nArtifact Security: Validate the integrity of all generated artifacts to prevent malicious changes from propagating through the deployment process.\nCommit Signing: Require signed commits to verify the authenticity of changes and prevent impersonation within the development process.\nPermissions Per Workflow: Restrict permissions in GitHub workflows to the minimal level necessary for each job, ensuring that excessive privileges are not available.\nRestrict Actions to Specified: In repo settings, only allow specified github actions. This prevents nested actions being changed to allow new insecure actions without our knowledge.\nUse Trusted Actions Only: Restrict workflows to use only approved actions maintained by the organization or trusted third parties to avoid introducing malicious actions.\n\n\n\nDo not use pull_request_target\nDescription\nUsing the pull_request_target event in GitHub Actions can expose secrets to workflows triggered by pull requests from forked repositories. While OIDC credentials are generally restricted in such cases, other secrets (e.g., GitHub tokens) can still be accessed by malicious workflows. This opens up the potential for unauthorized actions to be performed using these secrets.\nRisks\nUnauthorized access to secrets available to the GitHub Action workflow, such as tokens or API keys.\nExecution of malicious workflows that perform unauthorized actions in the repository or connected systems.\nMitigations\n\n\nTurn Off Running Forked PRs: Disable workflows from automatically running for forked PRs, requiring manual approval to ensure the workflow is safe to execute.\nPermissions Per Workflow: Minimize the permissions granted to workflows triggered by pull_request_target events, ensuring they only have access to what is absolutely necessary.\nNo Secrets in Forked PRs: Configure GitHub Actions secrets to not be accessible for workflows triggered by PRs from forks.\nCodeowners Approval: Require code owner approval for workflow changes in PRs, preventing unauthorized modifications from being merged.\nRestrict Actions to Specified: In repo settings, only allow specified github actions. This prevents nested actions being changed to allow new insecure actions without our knowledge.\nUse Trusted Actions Only: Restrict workflows to use only approved actions maintained by the organization or trusted third parties to avoid introducing malicious actions.\nMinimal App Permissions: Ensure the GitHub token used in workflows has the least privileges necessary to complete the required tasks, reducing the risk of abuse.\nArtifact Security: Validate the integrity of any artifacts generated in forked PR workflows to ensure malicious code hasn’t been introduced.\nReview Event Triggers: Use the pull_request event instead of pull_request_target where possible, as it limits the context to the fork’s scope and prevents access to repository secrets.\n\n\n\nMisconfigured Forking Permissions\nDescription\nIf forking permissions are misconfigured, workflows can automatically run for PRs originating from forked repositories. This can expose secrets or allow unauthorized actions using the GitHub token or other sensitive credentials. Forked PRs should not be allowed to trigger workflows without careful review and approval to ensure security.\nRisks\nExposure of secrets to potentially malicious workflows in forked repositories.\nUnauthorized actions performed using the GitHub token or other credentials.\nExecution of harmful workflows that compromise repository integrity or connected systems.\nMitigations\n\n\nTurn Off Running Forked PRs: Disable automatic workflow execution for PRs from forks. Require manual review and approval before running any workflows on forked PRs.\nPermissions Per Workflow: Configure granular permissions for workflows to ensure only the minimum necessary access is provided, reducing the impact of any unauthorized actions.\nNo Secrets in Forked PRs: Ensure that secrets are not accessible in workflows triggered by PRs from forked repositories.\nCodeowners Approval: Require code owner approval for all workflow changes to prevent unauthorized modifications from being merged.\nRestrict Actions to Specified: In repo settings, only allow specified github actions. This prevents nested actions being changed to allow new insecure actions without our knowledge.\nUse Trusted Actions Only: Restrict workflows to use only approved actions maintained by the organization or trusted third parties to avoid introducing malicious actions.\nMinimal App Permissions: Restrict the permissions of the GitHub token to the bare minimum required for each workflow, reducing the risk of abuse.\nReview Event Triggers: Use triggers like pull_request over pull_request_target for workflows to limit the access scope for workflows triggered by forks.\n\n\n\nPoorly defined version contraints\nDescription\nPackage management tools or GitHub workflows may unintentionally install a poisoned package due to poorly defined semantic version constraints. For example, using constraints like \u003e=8.1 or shorthand such as 8.1 might install a compromised version, such as 8.1.2. Similarly, not specifying constraints may allow the latest, potentially malicious, version to be installed. This can introduce malicious code into the pipeline or production environment.\nRisks\nExfiltration of sensitive credentials, secrets, or data.\nDestruction or creation of unauthorized resources in CI environments (e.g., fraud, cryptocurrency mining).\nFull compromise of CI pipelines or connected systems.\nMitigations\n\n\nStability Days: Configure automatic update tools like Renovate to introduce a delay between updates and deployments. This provides time to detect malicious changes in new package versions.\nPin Package Versions: Use exact version pins (8.1.1) whenever possible to reduce the risk of accidental upgrades to poisoned versions.\nUse SHA: As part of the version spec, where possible use the commit sha for the version constraint to avoid the issue where a tagged version being overwritten with different code.\nDependency Scanning: Use tools like Trivy to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies proactively.\n\n\n\nAccidental Secret Printing in Actions\nDescription\nAccidental action misconfigurations, such as improperly named environment variables or poorly managed logging mechanisms, may inadvertently expose sensitive data. For example, using echo or printenv statements in the wrong places can accidentally display secrets or environment variables that should not be visible, even to internal users. While external viewers (e.g., from forks or public repositories) would not see these secrets, they may still be accessible to internal actors with the right privileges or logs.\nRisks\nExposure of sensitive secrets, credentials, or configuration details within internal logs.\nPotential unauthorized access to internal systems or data if secrets are exposed to developers or team members.\nIncreased attack surface due to misconfigured logging or debugging outputs.\nMitigations\n\n\nStrict Inheritance: Limit inheritance of secrets between workflows. Ensure that only necessary secrets are passed down to sub-workflows to minimize risk of exposure.\nSensitive Variable Management: Make sure all secrets are passed between workflows as secrets and any generated in workflows are properly masked before being output anywhere.\n\n\n\nPull Request Hijacking\nDescription\nCommitting to another person’s PR allows users with write access to a repository to potentially make changes to a pull request that they did not originally submit. This can be abused by adding malicious changes (e.g., elevating their own access, modifying workflows, or injecting harmful code) to a PR and then approving it themselves. This becomes a significant risk if there are insufficient approval checks or a lack of separation of duties, especially in highly privileged environments.\nRisks\nMalicious code injected into production pipelines or codebase.\nUnauthorized access granted to sensitive environments or systems (e.g., elevated AWS or GitHub permissions).\nThe potential for the PR to bypass intended review processes due to self-approval.\nIntroduction of hidden backdoors or security vulnerabilities that may go unnoticed.\nMitigations\n\n\nGithub app: Ultimately one method of dealing with this would be to have an app that does a second approval only if the first approver had not committed to the branch. This was we could have two approvals needed but only need 1 actual person to approve.\nApproval Workflow Enforcement: Implement strict approval policies for sensitive repos that may require more than one approver (always minimum of 1).\nOIDC Per Environment: Use short-lived, branch-restricted OIDC credentials to limit the scope of AWS resources accessible by CI pipelines. This ensures that non-main branches cannot access production accounts.\nAWS Management Restricted: Scope AWS management account permissions to only allow access to essential resources, such as DNS or deployment tools, reducing potential damage.\nCodeowners Approval: Require Codeowners approval for any changes to sensitive files, including GitHub Actions workflows, to prevent unauthorized modifications.\nRestrict CI Access to Customer Data: Ensure that CI roles are denied access to customer data in services like S3, DynamoDB, or RDS, minimizing the potential for data breaches.\nMinimal AWS Credentials: Use narrowly scoped roles for specific tasks in the CI pipeline, such as ECR pushes or fetching secrets, reducing the permissions available to malicious modifications.\nCommit Signing: Require signed commits to verify the authenticity of changes and prevent impersonation within the development process.\nPermissions Per Workflow: Restrict permissions in GitHub workflows to the minimal level necessary for each job, ensuring that excessive privileges are not available.\nRestrict Actions to Specified: In repo settings, only allow specified github actions. This prevents nested actions being changed to allow new insecure actions without our knowledge.\nUse Trusted Actions Only: Restrict workflows to use only approved actions maintained by the organization or trusted third parties to avoid introducing malicious actions.\n\n\n\nOverprivileged Workflows\nDescription\nWhen workflows are over-privileged, they are granted more permissions than necessary for the tasks they need to perform. This increases the risk of exploitation, as an attacker who compromises the workflow or the repository can use the excess privileges to perform unintended or harmful actions, such as deleting resources, accessing sensitive data, or altering critical infrastructure.\nRisks\nExploitation of excessive permissions could lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of resources.\nCompromise of credentials could allow attackers to escalate privileges and take control of environments.\nMalicious actors could access sensitive customer data or infrastructure components that are outside the intended scope of the workflow.\nMitigations\n\n\nPermissions Per Workflow: Carefully define the permissions for each individual workflow. This ensures that only the necessary permissions are granted for specific tasks and that workflows cannot escalate privileges unnecessarily.\n\n","url":"/documentation/guides/github_actions_security_process.html"},"155":{"title":"OPG Terraform Modules","content":"OPG Terraform Modules\nScope\nThis guide will set out when \u0026 how we should use Terraform modules.\nOverview\nModules in Terraform are self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that are managed as a group.

Filenames within the Terraform project should also follow this\nconvention.\nExample:\nresource \"aws_security_group\" \"api_ecs_task\" { … }\nResources that exist in AWS should be all lowercase separated by hyphens,\nthey should all include the environment or account that they belong to in order\nto determine uniqueness and to be easily identifiable in the AWS Console. Using\nhyphens rather than underscores allows a resource to be easily identified as\neither a Terraform definition of a resource, or a “real” AWS resource.\nExample:\nresource \"aws_security_group\" \"api_ecs\" {\n  name = \"api-ecs-${terraform.workspace}\"\n}\nLanguage\nVersion pin all providers\nTerraform’s providers are constantly in flux. To avoid unexpected instability\nwe should ensure that all providers are pinned.\nUse Terraform Linting\nLinting helps to ensure a consistent code formatting, improves code quality and\ncatches common errors with syntax.\nRun terraform fmt before committing all code. Use a pre-commit hook to do this\nautomatically.\nDo not use HEREDOC for JSON, YAML or IAM Policies\nThere are better ways to achieve the same outcome using Terraform interpolations\nor resources\nFor JSON, use a combination of a local and the jsonencode function.\nFor YAML, use a combination of a local and the yamlencode function.\nFor IAM Policy Documents, use the native iam_policy_document resource.\nUse proper datatype\nUsing proper datatypes in Terraform makes it easier to validate inputs and\ndocument usage.\n\n\nUse null instead of empty strings (“”)\nUse bool instead of strings or integers for binary true/false\nUse string for freeform text\nUse object sparingly as it makes it harder to document and validate\n\nUse locals to baptize opaque resource IDs\nUsing locals makes code more descriptive and maintainable.\nRather than using complex expressions as parameters to some Terraform resource,\ninstead move that expression to a local and reference the local in the resource.\nVariables\nUse upstream module or provider variable names where applicable\nWhen writing a module that accepts variable inputs, make sure to use the same\nnames as the upstream to avoid confusion and ambiguity.\nUse all lowercase with underscores as separators\nAvoid introducing any other syntaxes commonly found in other languages such\nas CamelCase or pascalCase. For consistency we want all variables to look uniform.\nThis is also inline with the HashiCorp naming conventions.\nUse positive variable names to avoid double negatives\nAll variable inputs that enable/disable a setting should be formatted\n...._enabled (e.g. encryption_enabled).\nIt is acceptable for default values to be either false or true.\nUse feature flags to enable/disable functionality\nAll modules should incorporate feature flags to enable or disable functionality.\nAll feature flags should end in _enabled and should be of type bool.\nUse description field for all inputs\nAll variable inputs need a description field. When the field is provided by an\nupstream provider (e.g. terraform-aws-provider), use same wording as the upstream docs.\nUse sane defaults where applicable\nModules should be as turnkey as possible. The default value should ensure\nthe most secure configuration (E.g. with encryption enabled).\nUse variables for all secrets with no default value\nAll variable inputs for secrets must never define a default value.\nThis ensures that terraform is able to validate user input. The exception to\nthis is if the secret is optional and will be generated for the user\nautomatically when left null or \"\" (empty).\nOutputs\nUse description field for all outputs\nAll outputs must have a description set. The description should be based on\n(or adapted from) the upstream Terraform provider where applicable.\nAvoid simply repeating the variable name as the output description.\nUse well-formatted snake case output names\nAvoid introducing any other syntaxes commonly found in other languages such\nas CamelCase or pascalCase. For consistency we want all variables to look uniform.\nIt also makes code more consistent when using outputs together with Terraform\nremote_state to access those settings from across modules.\nNever output secrets\nSecrets should never be outputs of modules. Rather, they should be written to \nsecure storage such as AWS Secrets Manager, AWS SSM Parameter Store with KMS\nencryption, or S3 with KMS encryption at rest.\nOur preferred mechanism on AWS is using Secrets Manager.\nUse symmetrical names\nWe prefer to keep Terraform outputs symmetrical as much as possible with the\nupstream resource or module, with exception of prefixes. This reduces the amount\nof entropy in the code or possible ambiguity, while increasing consistency.\nBelow is an example of what *not to do. The expected output name is user_secret_access_key.\nThis is because the other IAM user outputs in the upstream module are prefixed with user_,\nand then we should borrow the upstream’s output name of secret_access_key to become\nuser_secret_access_key for consistency.\nState\nUse remote state\nUse Terraform to create state bucket\nThis requires a two-phased approach, whereby you first provision the bucket\nwithout the remote state enabled. Then enable remote state (e.g. s3 {}) and import\nremote state by simply rerunning terraform init. We recommend this strategy\nbecause it promotes using the best tool for the job and makes it easier to\ndefine requirements and use consistent tooling.\nUse backend with support for state locking\nWe recommend using the S3 backend with DynamoDB for state locking.\nUse encrypted S3 bucket with versioning, encryption and strict IAM policies\nWe recommend not commingling state in the same bucket. This could cause the\nstate to get overridden or compromised. Note, the state contains cached values\nof all outputs.\nUse .gitignore to exclude Terraform state files, state directory backups and core dumps\n.terraform\n.terraform.tfstate.lock.info\n*.tfstate\n*.tfstate.backup\nModule Design\nSmall Opinionated Modules\nWe believe that modules should do one thing very well. But in order to do that,\nit requires being opinionated on the design. Simply wrapping Terraform\nresources for the purposes of modularizing code is not that helpful.\nImplementing a specific use-case of those resource is more helpful.\n","url":"/documentation/guides/terraform_practices.html"},"158":{"title":"Baseline Coding Standards","content":"Baseline Coding Standards\nBaseline coding standards for OPG that teams can customise and adapt to their needs, starting from a common point\nStandards\n\n\nCode should conform to recognised style guides or standards, and take advantage of automatic style checkers, linters, and static analysis tools\nProject structures should follow the conventions of the language and frameworks used\nFavour clear variable and function names over acronyms, abbreviations and explanations in comments (and don’t assume technical and business domain knowledge)\nFavour open standards over proprietary or customised ones\nAny information or user interactable parts of the system must be Accessible\n\nCode should be:\n\n\nReadable\nCorrect, clear, and concise - in that order\nTested, automatically and with easily visible measures of what is covered\nSecure, and make use of automated tools like dependency scanners\nMaintained; addressing emerging user feedback, with libraries and kept up to date, and agreed pattern changes applied consistently across the application\nObservable, with adequate logging, tracing, metrics and alerts.

That might be accidental data loss, intentional data destruction or system failure from suppliers like AWS. Essentially asking the question: what happens when things go catastrophically wrong? This relates to service standard point 14, Operate a Reliable Service\nYour business continuity strategy should be:\n\n\nAppropriate and proportionate to the needs of the service and its users\nSupportable by the delivery team\nAgreed with the business\nDocumented (usually as part of your service’s GitHub repo)\n\nConversations around business continuity should include the Business, Product, Delivery, Developers, WebOps and Technical Architecture.\nWhat to look at during the Discovery / Alpha Stage\nDuring alpha and discovery phases you should be experimenting and testing your hypothesis. Business continuity work will be light touch at this stage. You should identify and understand what is proportional and appropriate for your product’s business continuity.\nGood questions to ask include:\n\n\nWhat is the impact of this proposed service failing on users and the business?\nWhat risks exist that you need to find mitigations for?\nWhich data will be key to your service functioning?\nWhich data only exists in your service?\nWhat are the business and user expectations around response and recovery?\nWhat non-digital fallbacks are in place already?\n\nAnswering these will help identify areas to build on in later phases.\nWhat to look at during Beta Stage\nDuring private and public beta stages you should focus on how your business continuity needs will impact the MVP build and how you can avoid issues in the future.\nDuring beta you should:\n\n\nIdentify how your service is likely to fail and which components are the greatest risk \nIdentify how any disaster recovery will impact how you build your infrastructure\nDefine recovery point objective and recovery time objective for your service\nIdentify who owns any business continuity processes inside and outside the delivery team\nDocument any disaster recovery in /docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md\nEnsure you have a backup and restore process for key data assets\nBuild familiarity with the incident management tools\nIdentify if your service is dependent on other systems and how much it can operate without them\nIdentify defensive coding and architectural practices to avoid or reduce dependencies\n\nFor Live products\nYou should document your support practices, disaster recovery plan and approaches before live assessment. However, you may have inherited a live codebase and need to bring it up to current standards.\n\n\nDo you need to retrofit a business continuity strategy for the product?\nHow regularly are you testing your Disaster Recovery plan?\nIs ownership of the Disaster Recovery plan clear?\nAre the team familiar with the incident management tools?\nHave any of the business needs, user needs or contacts changed?\n\nDifferences between internal-facing and external-facing services\nRequirements for recovery time (how quickly things are working again) and recovery point (what data is brought back) are different across different products and service areas depending on who uses them and the impact, both internally and externally of any downtime.\nFor example, downtime on a flagship service like Make An LPA has both impact to users and the business, but also reputational impact.\nSome products are the canonical source of truth for data in the OPG ecosystem. Others could be rebuilt from other sources. This will have a large impact on what a proportional plan is for your service.\nSome products are essential to the core work of the business and their failure has a large cost implication if staff aren’t able to work.\nFor example, downtime to Sirius has an impact on connected digital services and on the ability of core business functions. Whereas downtime for Complete the Deputy Report is inconvenient, but can be managed through good communication with users and stakeholders.\n","url":"/documentation/guides/business_continuity.html"},"160":{"title":"Joiners Movers Leavers","content":"Joiners Movers Leavers\nThe majority of our Joiners/Movers/Leavers processes can be carried out by using the opg-org-infra Terraform to assign permissions.
