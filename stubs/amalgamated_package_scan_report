This is the amalgated view of manifest and lock packages being used over our repositories, their licenses (where available), versions and location information.

This allows us to see a centralised view of what tooling we are using over the estate.

### Notes

In order for data to show here, the repository must include a workflow for our [github action](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-repository-scanner) such as [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ministryofjustice/opg-repository-reporting/main/.github/workflows/report.yml).

This [repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-technical-guidance/) then includes a workflow to run the [amalgamated action(https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-technical-guidance/)] of the report and finally within the publishing workflow a stage to fetch that report and merge it to this page.
